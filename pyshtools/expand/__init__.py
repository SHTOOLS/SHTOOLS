pyshtools Spherical Harmonic Expansion Routines.

This subpackage of pyshtools defines the following functions:

Equally sampled (N by N) and equally spaced (N by 2N) Grids
-----------------------------------------------------
SHExpandDH     Expand an equally sampled or equally spaced map into spherical
               harmonics using Driscoll and Healy's (1994) sampling theorem.
MakeGridDH     Create a 2D map from a set of spherical harmonic coefficients
               that conforms with Driscoll and Healy's (1994) sampling theorem.
SHExpandDHC    Expand an equally sampled or equally spaced complex map into
               complex spherical harmonics using Driscoll and Healy's (1994)
               sampling theorem.
MakeGridDHC    Create a 2D complex map from a set of complex spherical harmonic
               coefficients that conforms with Driscoll and Healy's (1994)
               sampling theorem.
MakeGradientDH Compute the gradient of a scalar function and return grids of
               the two horizontal components that conform with Driscoll and
               Healy's (1994) sampling theorem.

Gauss-Legendre quadrature grids
-------------------------------
SHGLQ          Precompute the weights and nodes used in the GLQ-based spherical
               harmonics routines.
SHExpandGLQ    Expand a 2D map sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes
               into spherical harmonics.

               sampled on a the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes.
SHExpandGLQC   Expand a 2D complex map sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature
               nodes into complex spherical harmonics.
MakeGridGLQC   Create a 2D complex map from a set of complex spherical harmonic
               coefficients sampled on a the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes.

               Legendre quadrature grids.

               harmonics at a single point.
SHMultiply     Multiply two functions and determine the spherical harmonic
               coefficients of the resulting function.
spharm         Compute all the spherical harmonic functions up to a maximum
               degree and order.
