Determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of a real function expressed in
complex harmonics rotated by three Euler angles.

Usage
-----
rcoef = SHRotateCoef (x, coef, dj, [lmax])

Returns
-------
rcoef : flaot, dimension (2, (lmax+1)*(lmax+2)/2)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the rotated function in indexed form.

Parameters
----------
x : float, dimension(3)
    The three Euler angles, alpha, beta, and gamma, in radians.
coef : float, dimension (2, (lmaxin+1)*(lmaxin+2)/2)
    The input complex spherical harmonic coefficients of the real function. This
    is an indexed array where the real and complex components are given by
    coef[0,:] and coef[1,:], respectively. The functions SHCilmToCindex and
    SHCindexToCilm are used to convert to and from indexed and cilm[:,:,:] form.
    The coefficients must correspond to unit-normalized spherical harmonics that
    possess the Condon-Shortley phase convention.
dj : float, dimension (lmaxin2+1, lmaxin2+1, lmaxin2+1)
    The rotation matrix dj(pi/2) obtained from a call to djpi2.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the input and output coefficients.

Description
-----------
SHRotateCoef will take the complex spherical harmonic coefficients of a real
function, rotate it according to the three Euler anlges in x, and output the
spherical harmonic coefficients of the rotated function. The input and output
coefficients are in an indexed form that can be converted to and from
cilm[:,:,:] form by using the functions SHCilmToCindex and SHCindexToCilm. The
coefficients must correspond to unit-normalized spherical harmonics that possess
the Condon-Shortley phase convention. Real spherical harmonics can be converted
to and from complex form using SHrtoc and SHctor. The input rotation matrix dj
is computed by a call to djpi2.

The rotation of a coordinate system or body can be viewed in two complementary
ways involving three successive rotations. Both methods have the same initial
and final configurations, and the angles listed in both schemes are the same.
This routine uses the 'y convention', where the second rotation axis corresponds
to the y axis.

Scheme A:

(I) Rotation about the z axis by alpha.
(II) Rotation about the new y axis by beta.
(III) Rotation about the new z axis by gamma.

Scheme B:

(I) Rotation about the z axis by gamma.
(II) Rotation about the initial y axis by beta.
(III) Rotation about the initial z axis by alpha.

The rotations can further be viewed either as a rotation of the coordinate
system or the physical body. For a rotation of the coordinate system without
rotation of the physical body, use

x(alpha, beta, gamma).

For a rotation of the physical body without rotation of the coordinate system,
use

x(-gamma, -beta, -alpha).

The inverse transform of x(alpha, beta, gamma) is x(-gamma, -beta, -alpha).

Note that this routine uses the "y convention", where the second rotation is
with respect to the new y axis. If alpha, beta, and gamma were originally
defined in terms of the "x convention", where the second rotation was with
respect to the new x axis, the Euler angles according to the y convention would
be alpha_y=alpha_x-pi/2, beta_x=beta_y, and gamma_y=gamma_x+pi/2.
