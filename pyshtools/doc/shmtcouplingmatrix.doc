This routine returns the multitaper coupling matrix for a given set of power
spectra of arbitrary localization windows. This matrix relates the expectation
of the localized multitaper spectrum to the expectation of the power spectrum of
the global function.

Usage
-----
Mmt = SHMTCouplingMatrix (lmax, tapers_power, [lwin, k, taper_wt])

Returns
-------
Mmt : float, dimension (lmax+lwin+1, lmax+1)
    The full multitaper coupling matrix that relates the expectation of the
    localized multitaper spectrum to the global power spectrum of the function.

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the global power spectrum.
tapers_power : float, dimension (lwinin+1, kin)
    An array of power spectra of the k windowing functions, arranged in columns.
lwin : optional, integer, default = lwinin
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the windowing functions in the array
    tapers.
k : optional, integer, default = kin
    The number of tapers utilized in the multitaper spectral analysis.
taper_wt : optional, float, dimension (kin)
    The weights used in calculating the multitaper spectral estimates. Optimal
    values of the weights (for a known global power spectrum) can be obtained
    from the routine SHMTVarOpt.

Description
-----------
SHMTCouplingMatrix returns the multitaper coupling matrix that relates the
expectation of the localized multitaper spectrum to the expectation of the
global power spectrum of the function (assumed to be stationary). This is given
by eqs 4.5 and 4.6 in Wieczorek and Simons (2007):

< S_{Phi Phi}^(mt) > = M^(mt) S_{ff}

where S_{Phi Phi} is a vector containing the lmax+lwin+1 localized multitaper
power spectral estiamtes, S_{ff} is a vector of the global power spectrum up to
degree lmax, and < ... > is the expectation operator. The coupling matrix is
given explicitly by

M_{ij} = Sum_{l=0}^L Sum_{k=1}^K a_k S_{hh}^{k}(l) [ C_{l0j0}^{i0} ]^2

where a_k are the taper weights, S_{hh} is the power of the window, and C is a
Clebsch-Gordon coefficient.

Note that this routine returns the "full" coupling matrix of dimension (lmax +
lwin + 1, lmax + 1). When multiplied by a global input power spectrum with
bandwidth lmax, it returns the output power spectrum with a bandwidth of lmax +
lwin. In doing so, it is implicitly assumed that input power spectrum is exactly
zero for all degrees greater than lmax. If this is not the case, the ouput power
spectrum should be considered valid only for the degrees up to and including
lmax - lwin.
