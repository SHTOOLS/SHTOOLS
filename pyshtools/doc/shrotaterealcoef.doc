Determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of a real function rotated by
three Euler angles.

Usage
-----
cilmrot = SHRotateRealCoef (cilm, x, dj, [lmax])

Returns
-------
cilmrot : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the rotated function, normalized for
    use with the geodesy 4-pi spherical harmonics.

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The input real spherical harmonic coefficients. The coefficients must
    correspond to geodesy 4-pi normalized spherical harmonics that do not
    possess the Condon-Shortley phase convention.
x : float, dimension(3)
    The three Euler angles, alpha, beta, and gamma, in radians.
dj : float, dimension (lmaxin2+1, lmaxin2+1, lmaxin2+1)
    The rotation matrix dj(pi/2), obtained from a call to djpi2.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the input and output coefficients.

Description
-----------
SHRotateRealCoef will take the real spherical harmonic coefficients of a
function, rotate it according to the three Euler anlges in x, and output the
spherical harmonic coefficients of the rotated function. The input and output
coefficients must correspond to geodesy 4-pi normalized spherical harmonics that
do not possess the Condon-Shortley phase convention. The input rotation matrix
dj is computed by a call to djpi2.

The rotation of a coordinate system or body can be viewed in two complementary
ways involving three successive rotations. Both methods have the same initial
and final configurations, and the angles listed in both schemes are the same.
This routine uses the 'y convention', where the second rotation axis corresponds
to the y axis.

Scheme A:

(I) Rotation about the z axis by alpha.
(II) Rotation about the new y axis by beta.
(III) Rotation about the new z axis by gamma.

Scheme B:

(I) Rotation about the z axis by gamma.
(II) Rotation about the initial y axis by beta.
(III) Rotation about the initial z axis by alpha.

The rotations can further be viewed either as a rotation of the coordinate
system or the physical body. For a rotation of the coordinate system without
rotation of the physical body, use

x(alpha, beta, gamma).

For a rotation of the physical body without rotation of the coordinate system,
use

x(-gamma, -beta, -alpha).

The inverse transform of x(alpha, beta, gamma) is x(-gamma, -beta, -alpha).

Note that this routine uses the "y convention", where the second rotation is
with respect to the new y axis. If alpha, beta, and gamma were originally
defined in terms of the "x convention", where the second rotation was with
respect to the new x axis, the Euler angles according to the y convention would
be alpha_y=alpha_x-pi/2, beta_x=beta_y, and gamma_y=gamma_x+pi/2.

This routine first converts the real coefficients to complex form using SHrtoc.
Then the coefficients are converted to indexed form using SHCilmToCindex, these
are sent to SHRotateCoef, the result if converted back to cilm complex form
using SHCindexToCilm, and these are finally converted back to real form using
SHctor.
