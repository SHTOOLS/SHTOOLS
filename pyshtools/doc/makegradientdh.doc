Compute the gradient of a scalar function and return grids of the two horizontal
components that conform with Driscoll and Healy's (1994) sampling theorem.

Usage
-----
theta, phi = MakeGradientDH (cilm, [lmax, sampling, lmax_calc, extend, radius])

Returns
-------
theta : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D map of the theta component of the horizontal gradient that conforms to
    the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994). If sampling is 1, the
    grid is equally sampled and is dimensioned as (n by n), where n is 2lmax+2.
    If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as (n by
    2n). The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
    latitudinal sampling interval is 180/n degrees, and the default behavior is
    to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first longitudinal band of the
    grid is 0 E, by default the longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and
    the longitudinal sampling interval is 360/n for an equally sampled and 180/n
    for an equally spaced grid, respectively. If extend is 1, the longitudinal
    band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which
    increases each of the dimensions of the grid by 1.
phi : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the phi component of the
    horizontal gradient.

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The real 4-pi normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of a scalar
    function. The coefficients c1lm and c2lm refer to the cosine and sine
    coefficients, respectively, with c1lm=cilm[0,l,m] and c2lm=cilm[1,l,m].
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients cilm. This
    determines the number of samples of the output grids, n=2lmax+2, and the
    latitudinal sampling interval, 90/(lmax+1).
sampling : optional, integer, default = 2
    If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (n by n). If 2, the
    grids are equally spaced (n by 2n).
lmax_calc : optional, integer, default = lmax
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions. This
    must be less than or equal to lmax.
extend : optional, bool, default = False
    If True, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
    for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of griddh by 1.
radius : optional, float, default = 1.0
    The radius of the sphere used when computing the gradient of the function.


Description
-----------
MakeGradientDH will compute the horizontal gradient of a scalar function on a
sphere defined by the spherical harmonic coefficients cilm. The output grids of
the theta and phi components of the gradient are either equally sampled (n by n)
or equally spaced (n by 2n) in latitude and longitude. The gradient is given by
the formula

Grad F = 1/r dF/theta theta-hat + 1/(r sin theta) dF/dphi phi-hat.

where theta is colatitude and phi is longitude. The radius r is by default set
to 1, but this can be modified by use of the optional parameter radius.

The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (n by n), but this
can be changed to use an equally spaced grid (n by 2n) by the optional argument
sampling. The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying the
optional argument extend.
