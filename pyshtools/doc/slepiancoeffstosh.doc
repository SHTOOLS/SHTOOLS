Convert a function expressed in Slepian coefficients to spherical harmonic
coefficients.

Usage
-----
flm = SlepianCoeffsToSH(falpha, galpha, nmax)

Returns
-------
flm : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the global function.

Parameters
----------
falpha : float, dimension (nmax)
    A vector containing the Slepian coefficients of the function.
galpha : float, dimension ((lmax+1)**2, nmax)
    An array containing the spherical harmonic coefficients of the Slepian
    functions, where lmax is the spherical harmonic bandwidth of the functions.
    Each column corresponds to a single function of which the spherical harmonic
    coefficients can be unpacked with SHVectorToCilm.
nmax : input, integer
    The number of expansion coefficients to compute. This must be less than or
    equal to (lmax+1)**2.

Description
-----------
SlepianCoeffsToSH will compute the spherical harmonic coefficients of a global
function flm given the Slepian functions galpha and the corresponding Slepian
coefficients falpha. The Slepian functions are determined by a call to either
(1) SHReturnTapers and then SHRotateTapers, or (2) SHReturnTapersMap. Each row
of galpha contains the (lmax+1)**2 spherical harmonic coefficients of a Slepian
function that can be unpacked using SHVectorToCilm. The Slepian functions must
be normalized to have unit power (that is the sum of the coefficients squared is
1), and the spherical harmonic coefficients are calculated as

f_lm = sum_{alpha}^{nmax} f_alpha g(alpha)_lm
