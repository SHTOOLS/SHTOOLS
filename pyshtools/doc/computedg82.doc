Compute the tridiagonal matrix of Grunbaum et al. (1982) that commutes with the
space-concentration kernel of a spherical cap.

Usage
-----
dg82 = ComputeDG82 (lmax, m, theta0)

Returns
-------
dg82 : float, dimension (lmax-abs(m)+1, lmax-abs(m)+1)
    The tridiagonal matrix of Grunbaum et al. (1982) that commutes with the
    space-concentration kernel of order M of a spherical cap.

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the windows.
m : integer
    The angular order of the concentration problem.
theta0 : float
    The angular radius of the spherical cap in radians.

Description
-----------
ComputeDG82 will calculate the tridiagonal matrix of Grunbaum et al. (1982) that
commutes with the space-concentration kernel of order m of a spherical cap. The
eigenfunctions of this matrix correspond to a family of orthogonal windowing
functions, and the eigenvalues correspond to the window's concentration factor
(i.e., the power of the window within theta0 divided by the total power of the
function). It is assumed that the employed spherical harmonic functions are
normalized to the same value for all degrees and angular orders, which is the
case for both the geodesy 4-pi and orthonormalized harmonics. The returned
matrix is symmetric, and the first element corresponds to (abs(m), abs(m)) as
the values for elements less than this are identically zero.
