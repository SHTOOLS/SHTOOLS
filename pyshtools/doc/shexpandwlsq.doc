Expand a set of irregularly sampled data points into spherical harmonics using a
weighted least squares inversion.

Usage
-----
cilm, chi2 = SHExpandLSQ (d, w, lat, lon, lmax, [norm,  csphase])

Returns
-------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function. The coefficients
    C0lm and C1lm refer to the cosine (Clm) and sine (Slm) coefficients,
    respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,l,m] and Slm=cilm[1,l,m].
chi2 : float
    The residual sum of squares misfit for an overdetermined inversion.

Parameters
----------
d : float, dimension (nmax)
    The value of the function at the coordinates (lat, lon).
w : float, dimension (nmax)
    The weights used in the weighted least squares inversion.
lat : float, dimension (nmax)
    The latitude in DEGREES corresponding to the value in d.
lon : float, dimension (nmax)
    The longitude in DEGREES corresponding to the value in d.
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the output coefficients cilm.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = Geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-normalized
    harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.

Description
-----------
SHExpandLSQ will expand a set of irregularly sampled data points into spherical
harmonics by a least squares inversion. When there are more data points than
spherical harmonic coefficients (i.e., nmax>(lmax+1)**2), the solution of the
overdetermined system will be determined. If there are more coefficients than
data points, then the solution of the underdetermined system that minimizes the
solution norm will be determined. See the LAPACK documentation concerning DGELS
for further information.

A weighted least squares inversion will be performed if the optional vector
weights is specified. In this case, the problem must be overdetermined, and it
is assumed that each measurement is statistically independent (i.e., the
weighting matrix is diagonal). The inversion is performed using the LAPACK
routine DGGGLM.

The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and csphase; if not set,
the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-
Shortley phase of (-1)^m.
