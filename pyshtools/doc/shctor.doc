Convert complex spherical harmonics to real form.

Usage
-----
rcilm = SHctor (ccilm, [lmax, convention, switchcs])

Returns
-------
rcilm : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lamx+1)
    The output real spherical harmonic coefficients. rcilm[0,:,:] and
    rcilm[1,:,:] correspond to the cosine and sine terms, respectively.

Parameters
----------
ccilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The input complex spherical harmonic coefficients. ccilm[0,:,:] and
    ccilm[1,:,:] correspond to the real and complex part of the coefficients,
    respectively. Only the positive angular orders are input; the negative
    orders are assumed to satisfy the relation C_{l-m}=(-1)^m C_{lm}^*.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum degree of the output coefficients.
convention : optional, integer, default = 1
    If 1 (default), the input and output coefficients will have the same
    normalization. If 2, orthonormalized coefficients will be converted to real
    geodesy 4-pi form.
swtichcs : optional, integer, default = 0
    If 0 (default), the input and output coefficients will possess the same
    Condon-Shortley phase convention. If 1, the input coefficients will first be
    multiplied by (-1)^m.

Description
-----------
SHctor will convert complex spherical harmonics of a real function to real form.
The normalization of the input and output coefficients are by default the same,
but if the optional argument convention is set to 2, this routine will convert
from geodesy 4-pi normalized coefficients to orthonormalized coefficients. The
Condon-Shortley phase convention between the input an output coefficients can be
modified by the optional argument switchcs.
