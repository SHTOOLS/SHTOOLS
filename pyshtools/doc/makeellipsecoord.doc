Compute the coordinates of an ellipse placed at a given latitude and longitude.

Usage
-----
coord = MakeEllipseCoord (lat, lon, dec, a_theta, b_theta, [cinterval])

Returns
-------
coord :float, dimension(360/cinterval, 2)
    The latitude [:,0] and longitude [:,1] coordinates of the ellipse in
    degrees.

Parameters
----------
lat : float
    The latitude of the center of the ellipse in degrees.
lon : float
    The longitude of the center of the ellipse in degrees.
dec : float
    Rotation angle of the semi-major axis of the ellipse in degrees with respect
    to local north.
a_theta : float
    The angular radius of the semi-major axis of the ellipse in degrees.
b_theta : float
    The angular radius of the semi-minor axis of the ellipse in degrees.
cinterval : optional, float, default = 1
    Angular spacing in degrees of the output latitude and longitude points. If
    not present, the default is 1.

Description
-----------
MakeEllipseCoord will calculate the (lat, long) coordinates of an ellipse placed
on a sphere at position (lat, lon). The semi-major and semi-minor axes,
expressed in angular radii in degrees, are given by a_theta and b_theta,
respectively. The semimajor axis of the ellipse is initially directed due north,
and it is then rotated clockwise by the angle dec. This is useful for plotting
ellipses on geographic maps. The first index in the output vectors corresponds
to the northern rotated semimajor axis, and subsequent points are arranged in a
clockwise manner. Input and output units are in degrees.
