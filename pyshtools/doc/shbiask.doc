Calculate the multitaper (cross-)power spectrum expectation of a function
localized by spherical cap windows.

Usage
-----
outcspectra = SHBiasK (tapers, incspectra, [lwin, k, ldata, taper_wt, save_cg])

Returns
-------
outcspectra : float, dimension (ldata+lwin+1)
    The expectation of the localized multitaper power spectrum.

Parameters
----------
tapers : float, dimension (lwinin+1, kin)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the localization windows. Each column
    corresponds to the non-zero coefficients of a single angular order. Since
    all that is necessary is the power spectrum of each window, the exact
    angular order is not required. These are generated by a call to
    SHReturnTapers or SHReturnTapersM.
incspectra : float, dimension (ldatain+1)
    The global unwindowed power spectrum.
lwin : optional, integer, default = lwinin
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localizing windows.
k : optional, integer, default = kin
    The number of localizing windows to use. Only the first k columns of tapers
    will be employed, which corresponds to the best-concentrated windows.
ldata : optional, integer, default = ldatain
    The maximum degree of the global unwindowed power spectrum.
taper_wt : optional, float, dimension (kin), default = -1
    The weights to apply to each individual windowed spectral estimate. The
    weights must sum to unity and are obtained from SHMTVarOpt. The default
    specifies that taper weights are not used.
save_cg : optional, integer, default = 0
    If set equal to 1, the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients will be precomputed and
    saved for future use (if lwin or ldata change, these will be recomputed). To
    deallocate the saved memory, set this parameter equal to 1. If set equal to
    0 (default), the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients will be recomputed for each
    call.

Description
-----------
SHBiasK will calculate the multitaper (cross-)power spectrum expectation of a
function multiplied by the k best-concentrated localization windows. This is
given by equation 36 of Wieczorek and Simons (2005) (see also eq. 2.11 of
Wieczorek and Simons 2007). In contrast to SHBias, which takes as input the
power spectrum of a single localizing window, this routine expects as input a
matrix containing the spherical harmonic coefficients of the localizing windows.
These can be generated by a call to SHReturnTapers or SHReturnTapersM.

It is assumed implicitly that the power spectrum of inspectrum is zero beyond
degree ldata. If this is not the case, the ouput power spectrum should be
considered valid only for the degrees up to and including ldata - lwin. Note
that this routine will only work when the window coefficients are non-zero for a
single angular order.

The default is to apply equal weights to each individual windowed estimate of
the spectrum, but this can be modified by specifying the weights in the optional
argument taper_wt. The weights must sum to unity. If this routine is to be
called several times using the same values of lwin and ldata, then the Clebsch-
Gordon coefficients can be precomputed and saved by setting the optional
parameter save_cg equal to 1.
