Calculate the eigenfunctions of the spherical-cap concentration problem for a
single angular order.

Usage
-----
tapers, eigenvalues = SHReturnTapersM (theta0, lmax, m, [degrees])

Returns
-------
tapers : float, dimension (lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the lmax+1 localization windows,
    arranged in columns. The first and last rows of each column correspond to
    spherical harmonic degrees 0 and lmax, respectively, and the columns are
    arranged from best to worst concentrated.
eigenvalues : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    The concentration factors of the localization windows.

Parameters
----------
theta0 : float
    The angular radius of the spherical cap in radians.
lmax : integer
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localization windows.
m : integer
    The angular order of the localization windows.
degrees : integer, optional, dimension (lmax+1), default = 1
    List of degrees to use when computing the eigenfunctions. Only those degrees
    where degrees[l] is non-zero will be employed.

Description
-----------
SHReturnTapersM will calculate the eigenfunctions of the spherical-cap
concentration problem for a singule angular order. The 4pi normalized spherical
harmonic coefficients of each window are given in the columns of tapers, and the
corresponding concentration factors are given in eigenvaules. The columns of
tapers are ordered from best to worst concentrated, and the first and last rows
of each column correspond to spherical harmonic degrees 0 and lmax,
respectively. The localization windows are normalized such that they have unit
power. If the optional vector degrees is specified, then the eigenfunctions will
be computed using only those degrees l where degrees(l) is not zero.

When possible, the eigenfunctions are calculated using the kernel of Grunbaum et
al. 1982 and the eigenvalues are then calculated by integration using the
definition of the space-concentration problem. Use of the Grunbaum et al. kernel
is prefered over the space-concentration kernel as the eigenfunctions of the
later are unreliable when there are several eigenvalues identical (within
machine precision) to either 1 or zero. If, the optional parameter degrees is
specified, and at least one element is zero for degrees greater or equal to
abs(m), then the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues will instead be computed
directly using the space-concentration kernel.
