Create a global map of the geoid.

Usage
-----
geoid = MakeGeoidGridDH (cilm, r0, gm, potref, [lmax, omega, r, order,
lmax_calc, a, f, sampling, extend])

Returns
-------
geoid : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A global grid of the height to the potential potref above a flattened
    ellipsoid of equatorial radius a and flattening f, where the grid conforms
    to the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994). If sampling is 1, the
    grid is equally sampled and is dimensioned as (n by n), where n is 2lmax+2.
    If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as (n by
    2n). The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
    latitudinal sampling interval is 180/n degrees, and the default behavior is
    to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first longitudinal band of the
    grid is 0 E, by default the longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and
    the longitudinal sampling interval is 360/n for an equally sampled and 180/n
    for an equally spaced grid, respectively. If extend is 1, the longitudinal
    band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which
    increases each of the dimensions of the grid by 1.

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The real spherical harmonic coefficients (geodesy normalized) of the
    gravitational potential referenced to a spherical interface of radius r0.
r0 : float
    The reference radius of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
gm : float
    The product of the gravitational constant and mass of the planet.
potref : float
    The value of the potential on the chosen geoid, in SI units.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the gravitational-potential
    coefficients. This determines the number of latitudinal and longitudinal
    samples.
omega : optional, float, default = 0
    The angular rotation rate of the planet.
r : optional, float, default = r0
    The radius of the reference sphere that the Taylor expansion of the
    potential is performed on.
order : optional, integer, default = 2
    The order of the Taylor series expansion of the potential about the
    reference radius r. This can be either 1, 2, or 3.
lmax_calc : optional, integer, default = lmax
    The maximum degree used in evaluating the spherical harmonic coefficients.
    This must be less than or equal to lmax.
a : optional, float, default = r0
    The semi-major axis of the flattened ellipsoid that the output grid geoid is
    referenced to. The optional parameter f must also be specified.
f : optional, float, default = 0
    The flattening (R_equator-R_pole)/R_equator of the reference ellipsoid. The
    optional parameter a (i.e., R_equator) must be specified.
sampling : optional, integer, default = 2
    If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (n by n). If 2, the
    grids are equally spaced (n by 2n).
extend : input, optional, bool, default = False
    If True, compute the longitudinal band corresponding to 360 E for gridtype
    1, 2 and 3, and compute the latitudinal band for 90 S for gridtype 2 and 3.

Description
-----------
MakeGeoidGrid will create a global map of the geoid, accurate to either first,
second, or third order, using the method described in Wieczorek (2007; equation
19-20). The algorithm expands the potential in a Taylor series on a spherical
interface of radius r, and computes the height above this interface to the
potential potref exactly from the linear, quadratic, or cubic equation at each
grid point. If the optional parameters a and f are specified, the geoid height
will be referenced to a flattened ellipsoid with semi-major axis a and
flattening f. The pseudo-rotational potential is explicitly accounted for by
specifying the angular rotation rate omega of the planet.

It should be noted that this geoid calculation is only strictly exact when the
radius r lies above the maximum radius of the planet. Furthermore, the geoid is
only strictly valid when it lies above the surface of the planet (it is
necessary to know the density structure of the planet when calculating the
potential below the surface).

The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (n by n), but this
can be changed to use an equally spaced grid (n by 2n) by the optional argument
sampling. The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying the
optional argument extend.
