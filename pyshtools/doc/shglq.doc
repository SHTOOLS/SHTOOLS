Precompute the weights and nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature based
spherical harmonics routines.

Usage
-----
zero, w = SHGLQ (lmax)

Returns
-------
zero : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    The nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature over latitude, determined
    from a call to PreGLQ.
w : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    The weights used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature over latitude, determined
    from a call to PreGLQ.

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients to be calculated
    in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature based spherical harmonic transform
    routines.

Description
-----------
SHGLQ will calculate the weights and zeros used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature
based spherical harmonic routines SHExpandGLQ, MakeGridGLQ, SHExpandGLQC, and
MakeGridGLQC.
