This routine returns the spherical harmonic coupling matrix for a given set of
spherical-cap Slepian basis functions. This matrix relates the power spectrum
expectation of the function expressed in a subset of the best-localized Slepian
functions to the expectation of the global power spectrum.

Usage
-----
kij = SHSCouplingMatrixCap (galpha, galpha_order, nmax)

Returns
-------
kij : float, dimension (lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The coupling matrix that relates the power spectrum expectation of the
    function expressed in a subset of the best-localized spherical-cap Slepian
    functions to the expectation of the global power spectrum.

Parameters
----------
galpha : float, dimension (lmax+1, nmax)
    An array of spherical-cap Slepian functions, arranged in columns from best
    to worst localized.
galpha_order : integer, dimension (kmaxin)
    The angular order of the spherical-cap Slepian functions in galpha.
nmax : input, integer
    The number of Slepian functions used in reconstructing the function.

Description
-----------
SHSCouplingMatrixCap returns the spherical harmonic coupling matrix that relates
the power spectrum expectation of the function expressed in a subset of the
best-localized spherical-cap Slepian functions to the expectation of the global
power spectrum (assumed to be stationary). The Slepian functions are determined
by a call to SHReturnTapers and each row of galpha contains the (lmax+1)
spherical harmonic coefficients for the single angular order as given in
galpha_order.

The relationship between the global and localized power spectra is given by:

< S_{\tilde{f}}(l) > = \sum_{l'=0}^lmax K_{ll'} S_{f}(l')

where S_{\tilde{f}} is the expectation of the power spectrum at degree l of the
function expressed in Slepian functions, S_{f}(l') is the expectation of the
global power spectrum, and < ... > is the expectation operator. The coupling
matrix is given explicitly by

K_{ll'} = \frac{1}{2l'+1} Sum_{m=-mmax}^mmax ( Sum_{alpha=1}^nmax g_{l'm}(alpha)
g_{lm}(alpha) )**2

where mmax is min(l, l').
