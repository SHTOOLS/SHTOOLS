Invert for the global power spectrum given a multitaper spectrum estimate formed
with spherical cap localization windows.

Usage
-----
mtdebias, lmid = SHMTDebias (mtspectra, tapers, nl, [lmax, lwin, k, taper_wt])

Returns
-------
mtdebias : float, dimension (2, n)
    The global power spectrum (column 1) and uncertainty (column 2). The
    midpoints of the n spherical harmonic bins are given in lmid.
lmid : float, dimension (n)
    The midpoints of the spherical harmonic bins for which the global power
    spectrum is constant.

Parameters
----------
mtspectra : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1)
    The localized multitaper spectrum estimate and uncertainty, obtained from a
    routine such as SHMultitaperCSE or SHMultitaperSE.
tapers : float, dimension (lwinin+1, kin)
    An array of the K windowing functions, arranged in columns, obtained from a
    call to SHReturnTapers.
nl : integer
    The global power spectrum is assumed to be constant within bins of spherical
    harmonic wdith nl. In addition, the global power spectrum will be assumed to
    be constant beyond lmax.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localized multitaper spectrum
    estimates.
lwin : optional, integer, default = lwinin
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the windowing functions in the array
    tapers.
k : optional, integer, default = kin
    The number of tapers utilized in the multitaper spectral analysis.
taper_wt : optional, float, dimension (kin)
    The weights used in calculating the multitaper spectral estimates. Optimal
    values of the weights (for a known global power spectrum) can be obtained
    from the routine SHMTVarOpt.

Description
-----------
SHMTDebias will invert for the global power spectrum given a localized
multitaper spectrum estimate formed from spherical cap localization windows.
This linear inverse problem is inherently underdetermined, and in order to
achive a unique solution it is assumed that the global spectrum is constant in
bins of width nl, and that the global power spectrum is constant for degrees
greater than lmax. In practice nl should be increased until the global power
spectrum is everywhere positive (negative values would be unphysical) and the
variances are reasonable. Further details can be found in Wieczorek and Simons
(2007).

This set of linear equations is solved using the method of singular value
decomposition as outlined in Press et al. (1992, pp. 670-672). Each value of the
multitaper spectrum estimate mtspectra[0,:], as well as the corresponding rows
of the transformation matrix, is divided by the uncertainties of the estimate
mtspectra[1,:]. The solution and uncertainty are given by eqs 15.4.17 and
15.4.19 of Press et al. (1992, p. 671), respectively.

If taper_wt is not specified, the weights will all be assumed to be equal to
1/K.
