Expand a 2D grid sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes into spherical
harmonics.

Usage
-----
cilm = SHExpandGLQC (gridglq, w, zero, [norm, csphase, lmax_calc])

Returns
-------
cilm : complex, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1) or (2, lmax_calc+1, lmax_calc+1)
    The complex spherical harmonic coefficients of the complex function. The
    first index specifies the coefficient corresponding to the positive and
    negative order of m, respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,l,m] and Cl,-m
    =cilm[1,l,m].

Parameters
----------
gridglq : complex, dimension (lmax+1, 2*lmax+1)
    A 2D grid of complex data sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes.
    The latitudinal nodes correspond to the zeros of the Legendre polynomial of
    degree lmax+1, and the longitudinal nodes are equally spaced with an
    interval of 360/(2*lmax+1) degrees. See also GLQGridCoord.
w : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    The Gauss-Legendre quadrature weights used in the integration over latitude.
    These are obtained from a call to SHGLQ.
zero : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    The nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature over latitude, calculated by
    a call to SHGLQ.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = 4-pi (geodesy) normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-
    normalized harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.
lmax_calc : optional, integer, default = lmax
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree calculated in the spherical harmonic
    expansion.

Description
-----------
SHExpandGLQC will expand a 2-dimensional grid of complex data sampled on the
Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes into complex spherical harmonics. This is the
inverse of the routine MakeGridGLQC. The latitudinal nodes of the input grid
correspond to the zeros of the Legendre polynomial of degree lmax+1, and the
longitudinal nodes are equally spaced with an interval of 360/(2*lmax+1)
degrees. It is implicitly assumed that the function is bandlimited to degree
lmax. If the optional parameter lmax_calc is specified, the spherical harmonic
coefficients will be calculated up to this degree, instead of lmax.

The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and csphase; if not set,
the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-
Shortley phase of (-1)^m. The normalized legendre functions are calculated in
this routine using the scaling algorithm of Holmes and Featherstone (2002),
which are accurate to about degree 2800. The unnormalized functions are accurate
only to about degree 15.

The spherical harmonic transformation may be speeded up by precomputing the
Legendre functions on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes in the routine SHGLQ
with the optional parameter cnorm set to 1. However, given that this array
contains on the order of lmax**3 entries, this is only feasible for moderate
values of lmax.
