Perform a localized multitaper cross-spectral analysis using arbitrary windows
derived from a mask.

Usage
-----
mtse, sd = SHMultiTaperMaskCSE (sh1, sh2, tapers, [lmax1, lmax2, lmaxt, k,
taper_wt, norm, csphase])

Returns
-------
mtse : float, dimension (lmax-lmaxt+1)
    The localized multitaper cross-power spectrum estimate. lmax is the smaller
    of lmax1 and lmax2.
sd : float, dimension (lmax-lmaxt+1)
    The standard error of the localized multitaper cross-power spectral
    estimates. lmax is the smaller of lmax1 and lmax2.

Parameters
----------
sh1 : float, dimension (2, lmax1in+1, lmax1in+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the first function.
sh2 : float, dimension (2, lmax2in+1, lmax2in+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the second function.
tapers : float, dimension ((lmaxtin+1)**2, kin)
    An array of the k windowing functions, arranged in columns, obtained from a
    call to SHReturnTapersMap. The spherical harmonic coefficients are packed
    according to the conventions in SHCilmToVector.
lmax1 : optional, integer, default = lmax1in
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of sh1. This must be less than or equal to
    lmax1in.
lmax2 : optional, integer, default = lmax2in
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of sh2. This must be less than or equal to
    lmax2in.
lmaxt : optional, integer, default = lmaxtin
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the windowing functions in the array
    tapers.
k : optional, integer, default = kin
    The number of tapers to be utilized in performing the multitaper spectral
    analysis.
taper_wt : optional, float, dimension (kin), default = -1
    The weights used in calculating the multitaper spectral estimates and
    standard error. Optimal values of the weights (for a known global power
    spectrum) can be obtained from the routine SHMTVarOpt. The default value
    specifies not to use taper_wt.
norm : optional, intger, default = 1
    1 (default) = 4-pi (geodesy) normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-
    normalized harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.

Description
-----------
SHMultiTaperMaskCSE will perform a localized multitaper cross-spectral analysis
of two input functions expressed in spherical harmonics, SH1 and SH2, using an
arbitrary set of windows derived from a mask. The maximum degree of the
localized multitaper power spectrum estimate is lmax-lmaxt, where lmax is the
smaller of lmax1 and lmax2. The matrix tapers contains the spherical harmonic
coefficients of the windows and can be obtained by a call to SHReturnTapersMap.
The coefficients of each window are stored in a single column, ordered according
to the conventions used in SHCilmToVector.

If the optional array taper_wt is specified, then these weights will be used in
calculating a weighted average of the individual k tapered estimates (mtse) and
the corresponding standard error of the estimates (sd). If not present, the
weights will all be assumed to be equal. When taper_wt is not specified, the
mutltitaper spectral estimate for a given degree is calculated as the average
obtained from the k individual tapered estimates. The standard error of the
multitaper estimate at degree l is simply the population standard deviation, S =
sqrt(sum (Si - mtse)^2 / (k-1)), divided by sqrt(k). See Wieczorek and Simons
(2007) for the relevant expressions when weighted estimates are used.

The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and csphase; if not set,
the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-
Shortley phase of (-1)^m.
