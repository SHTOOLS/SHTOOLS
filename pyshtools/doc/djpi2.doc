Compute the rotation matrix d(pi/2) used in rotating data expressed in spherical
harmonics.

Usage
-----
dj = djpi2 (lmax)

Returns
-------
dj : float, dimension (lmax+1, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The rotation matrix dj(pi/2).

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the spherical harmonic rotation.

Description
-----------
djpi2 will calculate the rotation matrix d_{mM}^j (pi/2) that is used in
rotating spherical harmonics in the routines SHRotateRealCoef and SHRotateCoef.

This routine is based on code originally written by Guy Masters.
