Calculate the spherical harmonic coefficients of a spherical cap.

Usage
-----
coef = SphericalCapCoef (theta, lmax)

Returns
-------
coef : float, dimension(lmax+1)
    The zonal spherical harmonic coefficients of a spherical cap centered over
    the north pole.

Parameters
----------
theta : float
    The angular radius of the spherical cap in radians.
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree to calculate the spherical harmonic
    coefficients.

Description
-----------
SphericalCapCoef will calculate the spherical harmonic coefficients of a
spherical cap centered over the north pole. The zonal coefficients, returned in
the array coef, are normalized such that the degree-0 term is 1, and are to be
used with either the geodesy 4-pi normalized or orthonormalized spherical
harmonics.
