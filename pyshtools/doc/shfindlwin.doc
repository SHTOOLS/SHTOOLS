Determine the spherical-harmonic bandwidth that is necessary to achieve a
certain concentration factor.

Usage
-----
lwin = SHFindLWin (theta0, m, alpha, [taper_number])

Returns
-------
lwin : integer
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth.

Parameters
----------
theta0 : float
    The angular radius of the spherical cap in radians.
m : integer
    The angular order of the taper.
alpha : float
    The desired concentration factor of the window. This must lie between 0 and
    1.
taper_number : optional, integer, default = 1
    The taper number corresponding to the angular order m. The default is to use
    the first taper.

Description
-----------
SHFindLWin will determine the spherical harmonic bandwidth that is required for
a window of the spherical-cap concentration problem to achive a certain
concentration factor. By default, the first taper corresponding to the angular
order m will be used, but this can be modified by specifying the optional
argument taper_number.
