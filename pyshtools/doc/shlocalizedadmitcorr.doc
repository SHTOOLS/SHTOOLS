Calculate the localized admittance and correlation spectra of two functions at a
given location using spherical cap localization windows.

Usage
-----
admit, corr, admit_error, corr_error = SHLocalizedAdmitCorr (gilm, tilm, tapers,
taper_order, lat, lon, [k, lwin, lmax, taper_wt, mtdef, k1linsig])

Returns
-------
admit : float, dimension (lmax-lwin+1)
    The admittance function, which is equal to Sgt/Stt.
corr : float, dimension (lmax-lwin+1)
    The degree correlation function, which is equal to Sgt/sqrt(Sgg Stt).
admit_error : float, dimension (lmax-lwin+1)
    The standard error of the admittance function.
corr_error : float, dimension (lmax-lwin+1)
    The standard error of the degree correlation function.

Parameters
----------
gilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxgin+1, lmaxgin+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the function G.
tilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxtin+1, lmaxtin+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the function T.
tapers : float, dimension (lwinin+1, kin)
    A matrix of spherical cap localization functions obtained from
    SHReturnTapers or SHReturnTapersM.
taper_order : integer, dimension (kin)
    The angular order of the windowing coefficients in tapers.
lat : float
    The latitude of the localized analysis in degrees.
lon : float
    The longitude of the localized analysis in degrees.
k : optional, integer, default = kin
    The number of tapers to be used in the multitaper spectral analysis.
lwin : optional, integer, default = lwinin
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localizing windows.
lmax : optional, integer, default = min(lmaxgin, lmaxtin)
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the input functions corresponding
    to gilm and tilm.
taper_wt : optional, float, dimension (k), default = -1 (not used)
    The weights to be applied to the spectral estimates when calculating the
    admittance, correlation, and their associated errors. This must sum to
    unity, and is only implemented for the case of mtdef=1. The default value
    specifies that taper weights will not be used.
mtdef : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default): Calculate the multitaper spectral estimates Sgt, Sgg and Stt
    first, and then use these to calculate the admittance and correlation
    functions. 2: Calculate admittance and correlation spectra using each
    individual taper, and then average these to obtain the multitaper admittance
    and correlation functions.
k1linsig : optional, integer, default = -1
    If equal to one, and only a single taper is being used, the errors in the
    admittance function will be calculated by assuming that the coefficients of
    gilm and tilm are related by a linear degree-dependent transfer function and
    that the lack of correlation is a result of uncorrelated noise. This is the
    square root of eq. 33 of Simons et al. 1997. The default value specifies
    that this is not set.

Description
-----------
SHLocalizedAdmitCorr will calculate the localized admittance and degree
correlation spectra of two functions at a given location. The windowing
functions are solutions to the spherical-cap concentration problem (as
calculated by SHReturnTapers or SHReturnTapersM), of which the best k
concentrated tapers are utilized. If k is greater than 1, then estimates of the
standard error for the admittance and correlation will be returned in the
optional arrays admit_error and corr_error. The symmetry axis of the localizing
windows are rotated to the coordinates (lat, lon) before performing the
windowing operation.

The admittance is defined as Sgt/Stt, where Sgt is the localized cross-power
spectrum of two functions G and T expressed in spherical harmonics. The
localized degree-correlation spectrum is defined as Sgt/sqrt(Sgg Stt), which can
possess values between -1 and 1. Two methods are available for calculating the
multitaper admittance and correlation functions. When mtdef is 1 (default), the
multitaper estimates and errors of Sgt, Stt, and Sgg are calculated by calls to
SHMultiTaperSE and SHMultiTaperCSE, and these results are then used to calculate
the final admittance and correlation functions. When mtdef is 2, the admitance
and correlation are calculated invidivually for each individual taper, and these
results are then averaged.

If the optional parameter k1linsig is specified, and only a single taper is
being used, the uncertainty in the admittance function will be calculated by
assuming the two sets of coefficients are related by a linear degree-dependent
transfer function and that the lack of correlation is a result of uncorrelated
noise.

When mtdef is 1, by default, the multitaper spectral estimates are calculated as
an unweighted average of the individual tapered estimates. However, if the
optional argument taper_wt is specified, a weighted average will be employed
using the weights in this array. Minimum variance optimal weights can be
obtained from the routines SHMTVarOpt if the form of the underlying global power
spectrum is known. Taper weights can not be used when mtdef is 2

This routine assumes that the input functions and tapers are expressed using
geodesy 4-pi normalized spherical harmonic functions that exclude the  Condon-
Shortley phase factor of (-1)^m.
