Compute the Wigner-3j symbols for all allowable values of J.

Usage
-----
w3j, jmin, jmax = Wigner3j (j2, j3, m1, m2, m3)

Returns
-------
w3j : float, dimension (j2+j3+1)
    An array of the Wigner-3j symbols evaluated for all allowable values of j.
    The minimum and maximum values of j are given by jmin and jmax.
jmin : integer
    The minimum value of j in the array w3j. This corresponds to the first
    element of w3j.
jmax : integer
    The maximum value of j in the array w3j. This corresponds to the last non-
    zero element of w3j.

Parameters
----------
j2 : integer
    A positive integer.
j3 : integer
    A positive integer.
m1 : integer
    An integer.
m2 : integer
    An integer.
m3 : integer
    An integer.

Description
-----------
Wigner3j will calculate the Wigner 3J symbols

/ j  j2 j3 \
\ m1 m2 m3 /

for all allowable values of j. The returned values in the array w3j are
calculated only for the limits

jmin = max(|j2-j3|, |m1|)  and

jmax = j2 + j3

To be non-zero, m1+m2+m3 must equal 0. It is assumed that all js and ms are
integers. Returned values have a relative error less than ~1.d-8 when j2 and j3
are less than about 100 (see below). In practice, this routine is probably
usable up to about 165.

The employed algorithm is based upon the stable non-linear recurrence relations
of Luscombe and Luban (1998) for the "non classical" regions near jmin and jmax.
The direction of the iteration starts from low values of j to high values, but
when abs(w3j(j+2)/w3j(j)) is less than one, the iteration will restart from high
to low values. For the classical region, the standard three term recursion
relationship is used (e.g., Schulten and Gordon 1975). As this three term
recursion can lead to overflows, the values are rescaled by a factor "scalef"
whenever the absolute value of the 3j coefficient becomes greater than unity.
More efficient algorithms probably exist for specific cases (for instance, when
all Ms are zero).

The results of this routine have been verified against the same routine run in
quadruple precision. For 1.e7 acceptable random values of j2, j3, m2, and m3
between -200 and 200, the relative error was calculated only for those 3j
coefficients that had an absolute value greater than 1.d-17 (values smaller than
this are for all practical purposed zero, and can be heavily affected by machine
roundoff errors or underflow). 853 combinations of parameters were found to have
relative errors greater than 1.d-8. Here I list the minimum value of max(j2,j3)
for different ranges of error, as well as the number of times this error
occurred:

max(j2,j3) = 103: 1.d-7 < error <=1.d-8 ; Number of occurrences = 483
max(j2,j3) = 116: 1.d-6 < error <= 1.d-7 ; Number of occurrences = 240
max(j2,j3) = 165: 1.d-5 < error <= 1.d-6 ; Number of occurrences = 93
max(j2,j3) = 167: 1.d-4 < error <= 1.d-5 ; Number of occurrences = 36

Many times, the large relative errors occur when the 3j coefficient changes sign
and is very close to zero (i.e., adjacent values are about 1.e7 times greater in
magnitude). Thus, if one does not need to know highly accurate values of the 3j
coefficients when they are almost zero (i.e., ~1.e-10) then this routine is
probably usable up to about 160.

These results have also been verified for parameter values less than 100 using a
code based on the algorith of de Blanc (1987), which was originally coded by
Olav van Genabeek, and modified by M. Fang. (This code was run in quadruple
precision and only calculates one coefficient for each call.) Maximum relative
errors between the two routines were less than 1.d-8 for a large number of
values (again, only 3j coefficients greater than 1.d-17 were considered here).
