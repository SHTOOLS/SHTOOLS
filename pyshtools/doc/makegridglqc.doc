Create a 2D complex map from a set of complex spherical harmonic coefficients
sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes.

Usage
-----
gridglq = MakeGridGLQC (cilm, zero, [lmax, norm, csphase, lmax_calc, extend])

Returns
-------
gridglq : complex, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D complex map of the function sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature
    nodes, dimensioned as (lmax+1, 2*lmax+1) if extend is 0 or (lmax+1,
    2*lmax+2) if extend is 1.


Parameters
----------
cilm : complex, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The complex spherical harmonic coefficients of the function. When evaluating
    the function, the maximum spherical harmonic degree considered is the
    minimum of lmax, lmaxin, or lmax_calc (if specified). The first index
    specifies the coefficient corresponding to the positive and negative order
    of m, respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,l,m+] and Cl,-m=cilm[1,l,m].
zero : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    The nodes used in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature over latitude, calculated by
    a call to SHGLQ.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic bandwidth of the function. This determines
    the sampling nodes and dimensions of the output grid.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = Geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-normalized
    harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.
lmax_calc : optional, integer, default = lmax
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the function. This
    must be less than or equal to lmax.
extend : input, optional, bool, default = False
    If True, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E.

Description
-----------
MakeGridGLQC will create a 2-dimensional complex map from a set of input complex
spherical harmonic coefficients sampled on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes.
This is the inverse of the routine SHExpandGLQC. The latitudinal nodes
correspond to the zeros of the Legendre polynomial of degree lmax+1, and the
longitudinal nodes are equally spaced with an interval of 360/(2*lmax+1)
degrees. When evaluating the function, the maximum spherical harmonic degree
that is considered is the minimum of lmax, lmaxin, or lmax_calc (if specified).

The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E is excluded from the grid by default,
but this can be computed by specifying the optional argument extend. The
employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase convention
can be set by the optional arguments norm and csphase; if not set, the default
is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-Shortley
phase of (-1)^m. The normalized legendre functions are calculated using the
scaling algorithm of Holmes and Featherstone (2002), which are accurate to about
degree 2800. The unnormalized functions are accurate only to about degree 15.

The reconstruction of the spherical harmonic function may be speeded up by
precomputing the Legendre functions on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature nodes in
the routine SHGLQ with the optional parameter cnorm set to 1. However, given
that this array contains on the order of lmax**3 entries, this is only feasible
for moderate values of lmax.
