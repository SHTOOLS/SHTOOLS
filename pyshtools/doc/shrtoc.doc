Convert real spherical harmonics to complex form.

Usage
-----
ccilm = SHrtoc (rcilm, [lmax, convention, switchcs])

Returns
-------
ccilm : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The output complex spherical harmonic coefficients. ccilm[0,:,:] and
    ccilm[1,:,:] correspond to the real and complex part of the coefficients,
    respectively. Only the positive angular orders are output; the negative
    orders can be calculated from the relation C_{l-m}=(-1)^m C_{lm}^*.

Parameters
----------
rcilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The input real spherical harmonic coefficients. rcilm[0,:,:] and
    rcilm[1,:,:] correspond to the cosine and sine terms, respectively.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum degree of the output coefficients.
convention : optional, integer, default = 1
    If 1 (default), the input and output coefficients will have the same
    normalization. If 2, real geodesy 4-pi coefficients will be converted to
    complex orthonormal form.
swtichcs : optional, integer default = 0
    If 0 (default), the input and output coefficients will possess the same
    Condon-Shortley phase convention. If 1, the input coefficients will first be
    multiplied by (-1)^m.

Description
-----------
SHrtoc will convert real spherical harmonics to complex form. The normalization
of the input and output coefficients are by default the same, but if the
optional argument convention is set to 2, this routine will convert from geodesy
4-pi normalized coefficients to orthonormalized coefficients. The Condon-
Shortley phase convention between the input an output coefficients can be
modified by the optional argument switchcs.
