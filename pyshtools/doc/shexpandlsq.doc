Expand a set of irregularly sampled data points into spherical harmonics using a
least squares inversion.

Usage
-----
cilm, chi2 = SHExpandLSQ (d, lat, lon, lmax, [norm,  csphase])

Returns
-------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function. The coefficients
    C0lm and C1lm refer to the cosine (Clm) and sine (Slm) coefficients,
    respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,l,m] and Slm=cilm[1,l,m].
chi2 : float
    The residual sum of squares misfit for an overdetermined inversion.

Parameters
----------
d : float, dimension (nmax)
    The value of the function at the coordinates (lat, lon).
lat : float, dimension (nmax)
    The latitude in DEGREES corresponding to the value in d.
lon : float, dimension (nmax)
    The longitude in DEGREES corresponding to the value in d.
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the output coefficients cilm.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = Geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-normalized
    harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.

Description
-----------
SHExpandLSQ will expand a set of irregularly sampled data points into spherical
harmonics by a least squares inversion. When the number of data points is
greater or equal to the number of spherical harmonic coefficients (i.e.,
nmax>=(lmax+1)**2), the solution of the overdetermined system will be
determined. If there are more coefficients than data points, then the solution
of the underdetermined system that minimizes the solution norm will be
determined. The inversions are performed using the LAPACK routine DGELS.

The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and csphase; if not set,
the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-
Shortley phase of (-1)^m.
