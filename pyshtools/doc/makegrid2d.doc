Create a 2D cylindrical map of arbitrary grid spacing from a set of spherical
harmonic coefficients.

Usage
-----
grid = MakeGrid2D (cilm, interval, [lmax, norm, csphase, f, a, north, south,
east, west, dealloc])

Returns
-------
grid : float, dimension ((north-south)/interval+1, (east-west)/interval+1)
    A 2D equally spaced map of the input spherical harmonic coefficients cilm.
    The  array is in raster format with upper-left and lower-right coordinates
    of (90 N, 0 E) and (90 S, 360 E), respectively.

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The real spherical harmonic coefficients to be expanded in the space domain.
    The coefficients C1lm and C2lm refer to the cosine (Clm) and sine (Slm)
    coefficients, respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,l,m] and Slm=cilm[1,l,m].
interval : float
    The latitudinal and longitudinal spacing of the output grid.
lmax :optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients cilm used when
    calculating the grid.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = 4-pi (geodesy) normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-
    normalized harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.
f : optional, float, default = 0
    The flattening of the reference ellipoid that is subtracted from the
    function. This is given by (R_equator-R_pole)/R_equator.
a : optional, float, default = 0
    The semi-major axis of the reference ellispoid that is subtracted from the
    function.
north : optional, float, default = 90
    The maximum latitude of the output raster grid, in degrees. The default is
    90 degrees.
south : optional, float, default = -90
    The minimum latitude of the output raster grid, in degrees. The default is
    -90 degrees.
east : optional, float, default = 360
    The maximum longitude of the output raster grid, in degrees. The default is
    360 degrees.
west : optional, float, default = 0
    The minimum longitude of the output raster grid, in degrees. The default is
    0 degrees.
dealloc : optional, integer, default = 0
    0 (default) = Save variables used in the external Legendre function calls.
    (1) Deallocate this memory at the end of the funcion call.

Description
-----------
MakeGrid2D will create a 2-dimensional cylindrical map, equally spaced in
(geocentric) latitude and longitude, from a set of input spherical harmonic
coefficients. The output grid is in raster format possessing upper-left and
lower-right coordinates of (90 N, 0 E) and (90 S, 360 E), repsectively. If the
optional parameters north, south, east and west are specified, then the output
grid will possess upper-left and lower-right coordinates of (north, west) and
(south, east), repsectively. The employed spherical harmonic normalization and
Condon-Shortley phase convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and
csphase; if not set, the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics
that exclude the Condon-Shortley phase of (-1)^m.

If the optional arguments f and a are specified, the output function will be
referenced to an ellipsoid with flattening f and semimajor axis a. The
normalized legendre functions are calculated in this routine using the scaling
algorithm of Holmes and Featherstone (2002), which are accurate to about degree
2800. The unnormalized functions are accurate only to about degree 15.
