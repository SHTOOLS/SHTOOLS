Determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of an irregularly sampled function
using a least squares inversion with a precomputed data kernel matrix.

Usage
-----
cilm, chi2 = SHExpandLSQ_G (d, lat, lon, lmax, g, [norm,  csphase])

Returns
-------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmax+1, lmax+1)
    The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function. The coefficients
    C0lm and C1lm refer to the cosine (Clm) and sine (Slm) coefficients,
    respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,l,m] and Slm=cilm[1,l,m].
chi2 : float
    The residual sum of squares misfit.

Parameters
----------
d : float, dimension (nmax)
    The value of the function at the coordinates (lat, lon).
lat : float, dimension (nmax)
    The latitude in degrees corresponding to the value in d.
lon : float, dimension (nmax)
    The longitude in degrees corresponding to the value in d.
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the output coefficients cilm.
g : float, dimension(nmax, (lmax+1)**2)
    The precomputed data kernel matrix G obtained from LSQ_G.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = Geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-normalized
    harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.

Description
-----------
SHExpandLSQ_G will determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of an
irregularly sampled function using a least squares inversion with a precomputed
data kernel matrix G. The matrix G can be obtained from the routine LSQ_G. When
the number of data points is greater or equal to the number of spherical
harmonic coefficients (i.e., nmax>=(lmax+1)**2), the solution of the
overdetermined system will be determined. If there are more coefficients than
data points, then the solution of the underdetermined system that minimizes the
solution norm will be determined. The inversions are performed using the LAPACK
routine DGELS.

The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and csphase; if not set,
the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon-
Shortley phase of (-1)^m.
