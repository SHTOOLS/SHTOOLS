Compute all the 4-pi (geodesy) normalized Legendre polynomials and first
derivatives.

Usage
-----
p, dp = PlBar_d1 (lmax, z)

Returns
-------
p : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    An array of 4-pi (geodesy) normalized Legendre polynomials up to degree
    lmax. Degree l corresponds to array index l.
dp : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    An array of the first derivatives of the 4-pi (geodesy) normalized Legendre
    polynomials up to degree lmax.

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The maximum degree of the Legendre polynomials to be computed.
z : float
    The argument of the Legendre polynomial.

Description
-----------
PlBar_d1 will calculate all of the 4-pi (geodesy) normalized Legendre
polynomials and first derivatives up to degree lmax for a given argument. These
are calculated using a standard three-term recursion formula, and the integral
of the geodesy-normalized Legendre polynomials over the interval [-1, 1] is 2.
Note that the derivative of the Legendre polynomials is calculated with respect
to its arguement z, and not latitude or colatitude. If z=cos(theta), where theta
is the colatitude, then it is only necessary to multiply dp by -sin(theta) to
obtain the derivative with respect to theta.
