Calculate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the space-concentration problem
for an arbitrary region.

Usage
-----
tapers, eigenvalues = SHReturnTapersMap (dh_mask, lmax, [n, ntapers, sampling,
degrees])

Returns
-------
tapers : float, dimension ((lmax+1)**2, ntapers)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients of the tapers, arranged in columns, from
    best to worst concentrated. The spherical harmonic coefficients in each
    column are indexed according to the scheme described in YilmIndexVector.
eigenvalues : float, dimension (ntapers)
    The concentration factor for each localization window specified in the
    columns of tapers.

Parameters
----------
dh_mask : integer, dimension (n, n*sampling)
    A Driscoll and Healy (1994) sampled grid describing the concentration region
    R. All elements should either be 1 (for inside the concentration region) or
    0 (for outside R).
lmax : integer
    The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localization windows.
n : optional, integer
    The number of latitudinal samples in dh_mask. The effective spherical
    harmonic bandwidth of this grid is L=n/2-1.
ntapers : optional, integer, default = (lmax+1)**2
    The number of best concentrated eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions
    to return in tapers and eigenvalues. The default value is to return all
    tapers.
sampling : optional, integer, default determined from dh_mask
    For 1, dh_mask has n x n samples. For 2, dh_mask has n x 2n samples. The
    default it to determine sampling from the dimensions of dh_mask.
degrees : integer, optional, dimension (lmax+1), default = 1
    List of degrees to use when computing the eigenfunctions. Only those degrees
    where degrees[l] is non-zero will be employed.

Description
-----------
SHReturnTapersMap will calculate the eigenfunctions (i.e., localization windows)
of the space-concentration problem for an arbitrary concentration region
specified in dh_mask (see Simons et al. (2006) for further details). The input
mask dh_mask must be sampled according to the Driscoll and Healy (1994) sampling
theorem with n samples in latitude, and possess a value of 1 inside the
concentration region, and 0 elsewhere. dh_mask can either possess n samples in
longitude (sampling=1) or 2n samples in longitude (sampling=2). Given the
approximate way in which the elements of the space-concentration kernel are
calculated (see ComputeDMap for details), sampling=2 should be preferred. The
effective spherical harmonic bandwidth (L=N/2-1) of the grid dh_mask determines
the accuracy of the results, and experience shows that this should be about 3
times larger than lmax.

The spherical harmonic coefficients of each window are given in the columns of
tapers, and the corresponding concentration factors are given in eigenvaules.
The spherical harmonic coefficients are ordered according to the scheme
described in YilmIndexVector, which can be converted to matrix form using
SHVectorToCilm, and the columns of tapers are ordered from best to worst
concentrated. The localization windows are normalized such that they have unit
power. If the optional parameter ntapers is specified, then only the ntapers
largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions will be calculated and
returned. If the optional vector degrees is specified, then the eigenfunctions
will be computed using only those degrees where degrees(l) is not zero.
