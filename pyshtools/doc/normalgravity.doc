Calculate the normal gravity on a flattened ellipsoid in geocentric coordinates
using the formula of Somigliana.

Usage
-----
value = NormalGravity (geocentriclat, gm, omega, a, b)

Returns
-------
value : float, ndarray
    The normal gravity in SI units.

Parameters
----------
geocentriclat: float, array_like
    Geocentric latitude in degrees.
gm : float
    The gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the planet.
omega : float
    The angular rotation rate of the planet.
a : float
    The semi-major axis of the flattened ellipsoid on which the normal gravity
    is computed.
b : float
    The semi-minor axis of the flattened ellipsoid on which the normal gravity
    is computed.

Description
-----------
NormalGravity will calculate the magnitude of the predicted gravity (in m/s^2)
on a flattened ellipsoid using Somigliana's formula. The latitude is input in
geocentric coordinates in degrees, which is later converted to geodetic
coordinates in the routine for use with Somigliana's formula. Other input
parameters include gm, the product of the gravitational constant and the
planet's mass, and the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the planet, a and b,
respectively. For further details, see sections 2.7 and 2.8 of Physical Geodesy
(Hofmann-Wellenhof and Moritz).
