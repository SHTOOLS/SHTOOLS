potential.

Usage
-----
rad, theta, phi, total, pot = MakeGravGridDH (cilm, gm, r0, [a, f, lmax,
sampling, lmax_calc, omega, normal_gravity, extend])

Returns
-------
rad : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D map of the radial component of the gravity field that conforms to the
    sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994). If sampling is 1, the grid is
    equally sampled and is dimensioned as (n by n), where n is 2lmax+2. If
    sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as (n by 2n).
    The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the latitudinal
    sampling interval is 180/n degrees, and the default behavior is to exclude
    the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first longitudinal band of the grid is 0
    E, by default the longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and the
    longitudinal sampling interval is 360/n for an equally sampled and 180/n for
    an equally spaced grid, respectively. If extend is 1, the longitudinal band
    for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which
    increases each of the dimensions of the grid by 1.
theta : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the theta component of the
    gravity field.
phi : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the phi component of the
    gravity field.
total : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the magnitude of the gravity
    acceleration.
pot : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the gravitational potential.

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The real 4-pi normalized gravitational potential spherical harmonic
    coefficients. The coefficients c1lm and c2lm refer to the cosine and sine
    coefficients, respectively, with c1lm=cilm[0,l,m] and c2lm=cilm[1,l,m].
gm : float
    The gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the planet.
r0: float
    The reference radius of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
a : optional, float, default = r0
    The semi-major axis of the flattened ellipsoid on which the field is
    computed.
f : optional, float, default = 0
    The flattening of the reference ellipsoid: f=(R_equator-R_pole)/R_equator.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients cilm. This
    determines the number of samples of the output grids, n=2lmax+2, and the
    latitudinal sampling interval, 90/(lmax+1).
sampling : optional, integer, default = 2
    If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (n by n). If 2, the
    grids are equally spaced (n by 2n).
lmax_calc : optional, integer, default = lmax
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions. This
    must be less than or equal to lmax.
omega : optional, float, default = 0
    The angular rotation rate of the planet.
normal_gravity : optional, integer, default = 1
    If 1, the normal gravity (the gravitational acceleration on the ellipsoid)
    will be subtracted from the total gravity, yielding the "gravity
    disturbance." This is done using Somigliana's formula (after converting
    geocentric to geodetic coordinates).
extend : input, optional, bool, default = False
    If True, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
    for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of griddh by 1.

Description
-----------
MakeGravGridDH will create 2-dimensional cylindrical maps from the spherical
harmonic coefficients cilm, equally sampled (n by n) or equally spaced (n by 2n)
in latitude and longitude, for the three vector components of the gravity vector
(gravitational force + centrifugal force), the magnitude of the gravity vector,
and the gravity potential (all using geocentric coordinates). The gravitational
potential is given by

V = GM/r Sum_{l=0}^lmax (r0/r)^l Sum_{m=-l}^l C_{lm} Y_{lm},

and the gravitational acceleration is

B = Grad V.

The coefficients are referenced to a radius r0, and the function is computed on
a flattened ellipsoid with semi-major axis a (i.e., the mean equatorial radius)
and flattening f. All grids are output in SI units, and the sign of the radial
components is positive when directed upwards.

If the optional angular rotation rate omega is specified, the potential and
gravity vectors will be calculated in a body-fixed rotating reference frame and
will include the contribution from the centrifugal force. If normal_gravity is
set to 1, the normal gravity will be removed from the magnitude of the gravity
vector, yielding the gravity disturbance. To convert m/s^2 to mGals, multiply
the gravity grids by 10^5.

The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on the
ellipsoid are greater than the maximum radius of the planet (the potential
coefficients are simply downward continued in the spectral domain). The
components of the gravity vector are calculated using spherical coordinates
whose origin is at the center of the planet, and the components are thus not
normal to the reference ellipsoid.

The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (n by n), but this
can be changed to use an equally spaced grid (n by 2n) by the optional argument
sampling. The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying the
optional argument extend.
