Read spherical harmonic coefficients from a JPL ascii-formatted file.

Usage
-----
cilm, lmax, gm = SHReadJPL (filename, lmaxin, [formatstring])

Returns
-------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The spherical harmonic coefficients contained in filename.
lmax : integer
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of cilm.
gm : float, dimension(2)
    The mass-gravitational constant and error.

Parameters
----------
filename : character(*)
    The filename of the JPL ascii-formatted spherical harmonic coefficients.
lmaxin : integer
    This spherical harmonic degree controls the dimension of the output array
    cilm. The coefficients between lmax+1 and lmaxin will be set to zero.
formatstring : character(6), optional, default = "E19.12"
    The format string used to read the elements of cilm. The default is
    "E19.12".

Description
-----------
SHReadJPL will read spherical harmonic coefficients from a JPL ascii formatted
file into an array cilm. The real numbers are assumed to be formated with the
specifier E19.12, but this can be changed by specifiying the optional string
formatstring.

The JPL ascii-formatted file is organized as follows:

- Comment lines starting with "#".
- gm (if a gravitational potential file)
- A list of J_l, which is -cilm[0,l,0].
- A list of the cosine and sine terms.
- The errors of the above (starting at step 2).
