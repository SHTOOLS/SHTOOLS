This submodule of pyshtools defines the following functions:

Spherical harmonic I/O
----------------------
SHRead           Read spherical harmonic coefficients from an ascii-formatted
                 file.
SHReadH          Read spherical harmonic coefficients from an ascii-formatted
                 file with a header line.
SHReadError      Read spherical harmonic coefficients and associated errors
                 from an ascii-formatted file.
SHReadErrorH     Read spherical harmonic coefficients and associated errors
                 from an ascii-formatted file with a header line.
SHRead2          Read spherical harmonic coefficients from a CHAMP or GRACE-
                 like ascii-formatted file.
SHRead2Error     Read spherical harmonic coefficients and associated errors
                 from a CHAMP or GRACE-like ascii-formatted file.
SHReadJPL        Read spherical harmonic coefficients from a JPL ascii-
                 formatted file.
SHReadJPLError   Read spherical harmonic coefficients and associated errors
                 from a JPL ascii-formatted file.

Spherical harmonic storage
--------------------------
SHCilmToCindex   Convert a three-dimensional array of complex spherical
                 harmonic coefficients to a two-dimensional indexed array.
SHCindexToCilm   Convert a two-dimensional indexed array of complex spherical
                 harmonic coefficients to a three-dimensional array.
SHCilmToVector   Convert a 3-dimensional array of real spherical harmonic
                 coefficients to a 1-dimensional ordered array.
SHVectorToCilm   Convert a 1-dimensional indexed vector of real spherical
                 harmonic coefficients to a 3-dimensional array.
YilmIndexVector  Determine the index of a 1D ordered vector of spherical
                 harmonic coefficients corresponding to I, L, and M.

Spherical harmonic conversions
------------------------------
SHrtoc           Convert real spherical harmonics to complex form.
SHctor           Convert complex spherical harmonics to real form.
