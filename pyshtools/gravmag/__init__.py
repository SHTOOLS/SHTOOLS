This subpackage of pyshtools defines the following functions:

Gravity routines
----------------
MakeGravGridDH      Create 2D cylindrical maps on a flattened and rotating
                    ellipsoid of all three components of the gravity field,
                    the gravity disturbance, and the gravitational potential.
MakeGravGradGridDH  Calculate the components of the gravity "gradient" tensor
                    on a flattened ellipsoid.
MakeGeoidGridDH     Create a global map of the geoid.
CilmPlusDH          Calculate the gravitational potential exterior to relief
                    along a spherical interface using the finite-amplitude
                    algorithm of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998) on a Driscoll
                    and Healy (1994) grid.
CilmMinusDH         Calculate the gravitational potential interior to relief
                    along to a spherical interface using the finite-amplitude
                    algorithm of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998) on a Driscoll
                    and Healy (1994) grid.
CilmPlusRhoHDH      Calculate the gravitational potential exterior to relief
                    along a spherical interface with laterally varying density
                    using the finite amplitude algorithm of Wieczorek (2007)
                    on a Driscoll and Healy (1994) grid.
CilmMinusRhoHDH     Calculate the gravitational potential interior to relief
                    along a spherical interface with laterally varying density
                    using the finite amplitude algorithm of Wieczorek (2007)
                    on a Driscoll and Healy (1994) grid.
BAtoHilmDH          Calculate iteratively the relief along an interface with
                    constant density contrast that corresponds to a given
                    Bouguer anomaly using the algorithm of Wieczorek and
                    Phillips (1998).
BAtoHilmRhoHDH      Iteratively calculate the relief along an interface with
                    laterally varying density contrast that corresponds to a
                    given Bouguer anomaly using the algorithm of Wieczorek and
                    Phillips (1998).
DownContFilterMA    Compute the minimum-amplitude downward continuation filter
                    of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998).
DownContFilterMC    Calculate a minimum-curvature downward continuation filter
                    for a given spherical harmonic degree.
NormalGravity       Calculate the normal gravity on a flattened ellipsoid
                    using the formula of Somigliana.

Magnetics routines
------------------
MakeMagGridDH       Create 2D cylindrical maps on a flattened ellipsoid of
                    all three vector components of the magnetic field, the
                    magnitude of the magnetic field, and the magnetic
                    potential.
mag_spectrum        Compute the spectrum of either the magnetic potential
                    or magnetic field strength.
