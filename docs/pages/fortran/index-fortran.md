## Features

* Supports all standard normalizations and phase conventions of the spherical harmonic functions.

* Use of both regularly sampled geographic grids and grids appropriate for Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

* Spherical harmonic transforms proven to be accurate up to about degree 2800.

* Perform localized multitaper spectral analyses, or expand functions in terms of localized Slepian basis.

* Perform basic operations on global gravity and magnetic field data.

* OpenMP compatible and OpenMP thread-safe versions of the Fortran routines.

## Easy installation

To install the Fortran 95 components for use in your Fortran programs, execute one or both of the following commands in the SHTOOLS directory

```bash
make fortran
make fortran-mp  # for OpenMP support
```

Alternatively, install using the [brew](http://brew.sh/) package manager (macOS)

```bash
brew tap shtools/shtools
brew install shtools
brew install shtools --with-openmp  # to install shtools with the OpenMP components
```

or the [macports](https://www.macports.org/) package manager (macOS)
```bash
sudo port install shtools
sudo port install shtools +openmp  # to install shtools with the OpenMP components
```
