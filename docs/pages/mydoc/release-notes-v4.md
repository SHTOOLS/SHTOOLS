## Version 4.2

**Change log:**

* Full support added for the use of unnormalized harmonics in the classes `SHCoeffs` and `SHGrid`. To make use of this normalization, just specify `normalization='unnorm'`.
* Added a new python native routine `mag_spectrum()` in the subpackage `gravmag` that replaces the original fortran wrapped routines. The old python wrapped functions have been removed from pyshtools. This new routine is nearly the same as `spectrum()`, and further allows one to compute the spectrum of the potential or magnetic intensity.
* The old fortran based `SHRead` function has been replaced with a python native version `shread()`. The functionality is nearly identical as before, and combines the previous routines `SHRead`, `SHReadError`, `SHReadErrorH` and `SHReadH` into one. Differences include: (1) It is no longer necessary to specify the lmax of the file: This is determined automatically by reading the file from the end, (2) both real and complex coefficients are supported, (3) a header line can be output, but it is a simple list of type str that will need to be converted to the correct format by the user, and (4) "comment" lines are read and ignored: A valid line is one where there are 4 or more words, and where the first two words are integers.
* A new python native function `convert()` was added in the subpackage `shio` that converts between arrays of spherical harmonic coefficients with different normalizations. The class `SHCoeffs` was then simplified by using this external function for all conversions involving `SHCoeffs` class instances.
* The optional parameter lmax was added to `SHCoeffs.spectrum()`.
* When plotting grid from the class `SHGrid`, one can now specify the label to use for the x and y axes with `xlabel` and `ylabel`, as well as the interval to use when plotting ticks on both axes using `tick_interval`.
* The pyshtools rotation routines now allow you to specify the optional parameter `convention` to treat Euler angles in either the `x` or `y` conventions (i.e., which axes to use for the second rotation). Furthermore, the optional argument `body` allows you to specify if you want to rotate the body (True), or coordinate system (False, default). The tutorial number 3 was updated to clear up some inconsistencies in how the angles were defined.
* New optional parameters added to `SHWindow.plot_windows()` and `SHWindow.plot_spectra()` that include `xlim` and `ylim` for the limits when plotting spectra, `maxcolumns` for the number of columns to use when plotting several windows, and `lmax` which controls the grid spacing when plotting the windows.
* Added the optional argument `lmax` to `SHCoeffs.from_random()` that allows you to create coefficients with maximum bandwidths that are either greater or less than the bandwidth of the input power spectrum.
* Added a warning message when using `SHCoeffs.rotate()` with degrees greater than 1200, as the routine is not accurate beyond this value.
* Added an optional argument `legend` to `SHWindow.plot_windows()` to control whether the legend is plotted or not.
* Fixed a minor bug in ClassExample.py file concerning the use of `SHCoeffs.rotate()`.
* Added support for plotting to an already existing figure by allowing the user to specify an existing matplotlib axes.
* Removed some non-standard ascii dashes in the documentation files, and forced all doc files to be opened as `utf-8`.
* HTML documentation was completely redone using Jekyll. The markdown source files are now located in `pages/mydoc`. A static html web site is built using `jekyll`, whose files are located in `doc`. Github will automatically create the static pages and serve them on [shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS](https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/). To build the static pages yourself, it is only necessary to execute `bundle exec jekyll build` in the directory `doc`, which will build the site into `_site` in the same directory. Alternatively, `make www` in the main directory will create a static site in the top-level directory `www` that could be used to deploy on a different web server. The site is based on the template [Jekyll documentation theme](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll) by @tomjoht.

## Version 4.1

This version adds improved functionality to SHTOOLS and fixes a couple of minor bugs. In addition, this release will be the first where pre-built wheels for unix/macOS/windows will be distributed via PYPI.

**Change log:**

* Added an optional argument `lmax` to `SHCoeffs.from_array()`.
* Coefficients are zero-padded when `lmax` is greater than the maximum degree in `SHCoeffs.to_array()`.
* The method `pad()` was added to the `SHCoeffs` class that zero pads or truncates the coefficients to a different `lmax`.
* Fixed the method `SHCoeffs.from_file()` such that the maximum spherical harmonic degree of the class is the maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coeffs (and not `lmaxin` as before).
* Fixed formatting issues with error messages in `SHCoeffs`.
* Removed print statements from the fortran code in `BAtoHilm` and `BAtoHilmRohH` that served no purpose.
* Fixed a bug in the argument order of the python wrappers of `CilmPlusRhoDH` and `BAtoHilmRhoDH`.
* Fixed the makefile to remove the `dist` directory during clean.
* Fixed a bug in the python routine `cross_spectrum()`, where the numpy arange function was incorrectly called.
* Fixed the`SHWindow` plotting methods to work when the number of rows is equal to 1.
* Conditional tests in the routine `Wigner3j` were reordered to avoid a division by zero.
* Numpy's auto-configuration is now used to detect the LAPACK libraries.
* Many minor updates to the python documentation and unix man pages.

## Version 4.0
This is a major update that fixes bugs, adds new functionality, and improves Python error handing. All users are requested to upgrade to 4.0.

**Change log:**

* Instead of executing a Fortran STOP, which kills the Python kernel, the Fortran subroutines now return an `exitstatus` that allows Python to raise an exception. This technique does not work with the few Fortran functions that pyshtools calls, but these functions are relatively benign, and will soon be phased out for Python native functions.
* The Fortran `powerspectrum` routines have been removed from pyshtools, and have been replaced with Python native routines `spectrum` and `cross_spectrum`. The Python routines allow to specify the normalization, whether the output should be power, energy or l2norm, and whether the spectrum is per degree, per coefficient, or per log bandwidth.
* The method `plot_spectrum2d()` was added to the class `SHCoeffs` to plot the power as a function of degree and order.
* All pyshtools modules have been converted into proper Python subpackages. The subpackage `localizedpsectralanalysis` has been merged into `spectralanalysis`, and the subpackage `other` has been renamed `utils`.
* The Python class method `SHCoeffs.expand()` now can evaluate the function either on an SHGrid or for a list of latitude and longitude points. As part of this change, a new fortran function `MakeGridPointC` was created for complex coefficients.
* The majority of the methods for the classes `SHCoeffs`, `SHGrid` and `SHWindow` have been rename for consistency (see documentation!). Also, the classes now give the option of reading or saving to files as numpy arrays.
* Added new Python function `read_icgen_gfc` for reading ICGEM-format gravity coefficient files.
* The operator `pow` was added to the class `SHCoeffs`.
* All methods in the pyshtools classes now return copies by default, which can be modified by the optional argument `copy`.
* Added `pot` as a mandatory return argument for the Python routine `MakeGravGridDH`.
* Several minor modifications and bug fixes were made to the makefiles to improve compatibility and to allow the use of `make -j`.
* The routines `other.EigValSym`, `other.EigValVecSym`, `other.EigValVecSymTri`, `other.RandomGaussian`, `other.RandomN` and `other.PreGLQ` were removed from pyshtools, as these can be found in other scipy packages.
* The SHTOOLS routine `DHaj` was added to the pyshtools subpackage `utils`.
* Python docstrings have been streamlined and standardized.
* ...plus, many minor changes and optimizations...
