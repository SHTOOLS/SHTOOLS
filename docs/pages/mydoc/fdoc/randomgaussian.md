Return a pseudo-Gaussian deviate of zero mean and unit variance.

## Usage

`rg` = RandomGaussian (`seed`)

## Parameters

`rg` : output, real\*8
:   The radom Gaussian deviate.

`seed` : input/output, integer
:   Input a negative integer to (re-)initialize the random number generator. Afterwards, this argument should not be modified.

## Description

`RandomGaussian` will return a Gaussian random deviate with unit variance and zero mean. The underlying random number generator uses the algorithm of Park and Miller combined with a Marsaglia shift sequence, which is claimed to have a periodicity of about 3.1 10^18. The random number generator is intialized by calling with a negative value of `seed`, and afterwards, this variable should not be modified. To obtain a Gaussian deviate with a standard deviation of `sigma`, it is only necessary to multiply the unit variance deviate by `sigma`.

This is a slightly modified version of the algorithm that was published in NUMERICAL RECIPES as GASDEV.
