Calculate the eigenfunctions of the spherical-cap concentration problem for a single angular order.

## Usage

call SHReturnTapersM (`theta0`, `lmax`, `m`, `tapers`, `eigenvalues`, `shannon`, `exitstatus`)

## Parameters

`theta0` : input, real\*8
:   The angular radius of the spherical cap in radians.

`lmax` : input, integer
:   The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localization windows.

`m` : input, integer
:   The angular order of the localization windows.

`tapers` : output, real\*8, dimension (`lmax`+1, `lmax`+1)
:   The spherical harmonic coefficients of the `lmax+1` localization windows, arranged in columns. The first and last rows of each column correspond to spherical harmonic degrees 0 and `lmax`, respectively, and the columns are arranged from best to worst concentrated. 

`eigenvalues` : output, real\*8, dimension (`lmax`+1)
:   The concentration factors of the localization windows.

`shannon` : output, optional, real\*8
:   The Shannon number, which is the trace of the concentration kernel.

`exitstatus` : output, optional, integer
:   If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered, the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error. 0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO error.

## Description

`SHReturnTapersM` will calculate the eigenfunctions (i.e., localization windows) of the spherical-cap concentration problem for a singular angular order. The spherical harmonic coefficients of each window are given in the columns of `tapers`, and the corresponding concentration factors are given in `eigenvaules`. The columns of `tapers` are ordered from best to worst concentrated, and the first and last rows of each column correspond to spherical harmonic degrees 0 and `lmax`, respectively. The localization windows are normalized such that they have unit power.
