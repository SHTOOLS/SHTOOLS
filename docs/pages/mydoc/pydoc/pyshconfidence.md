Compute the probability that two functions are correlated at a given spherical harmonic degree for a given correlation coefficient.

## Usage

`prob` = SHConfidence (`l`, `corr`)

## Returns

`prob` : float
:   Probability that two functions expressed in spherical coefficients with spectral correlation `corr` are correlated at degree `l`.

## Parameters

`l` :  integer
:   The spherical harmonic degree.

`corr` : float
:   The correlation coefficient of the two data sets at degree `l`.

## Description

`SHConfidence` will calculate the probability (between 0 and 1) that two sets of spherical harmonic coefficients with spectral correlation `corr` are linearly correlated at a given degree. This is calculated using equation A7 from Pauer et al. (2006).
