Calculate the eigenfunctions of the spherical-cap concentration problem.

## Usage

`tapers`, `eigenvalues`, `taper_order` = SHReturnTapers (`theta0`, `lmax`)

## Returns

`tapers` : float, dimension (`lmax`+1, (`lmax`+1)\*\*2)
:   The spherical harmonic coefficients of the `(lmax+1)**2` localization windows. Each column contains the coefficients of a single window that possesses non-zero coefficients for the single angular order specified in `taper_order`. The first and last rows of each column correspond to spherical harmonic degrees 0 and `lmax`, respectively, and the columns are arranged from best to worst concentrated.

`eigenvalues` : float, dimension ((`lmax`+1)\*\*2)
:   The concentration factors of the localization windows.

`taper_order` : integer, dimension ((`lmax`+1)\*\*2)
:   The angular order of the non-zero spherical harmonic coefficients in each column of `tapers`.

## Parameters

`theta0` : float
:   The angular radius of the spherical cap in radians.

`lmax` : integer
:   The spherical harmonic bandwidth of the localization windows.

## Description

`SHReturnTapers` will calculate the eigenfunctions (i.e., localization windows) of the spherical-cap concentration problem. Each column of the matrix `tapers` contains the spherical harmonic coefficients of a single window and the corresponding concentration factor is given in the array `eigenvalues`. Each window has non-zero coefficients for only a single angular order that is specified in `taper_order`: all other spherical harmonic coefficients for a given window are identically zero. The columns of `tapers` are ordered from best to worst concentrated, and the first and last rows of each column correspond to spherical harmonic degrees 0 and `lmax`, respectively. The localization windows are normalized such that they have unit power.
