Compute the latitudinal weights used in the Driscoll and Healy (1994) spherical harmonic transform.

## Usage

`aj` = DHaj (`n`)

## Returns

`aj` : float, dimension (`n`)
:   The latitudinal weights used in the spherical harmonic transform.

## Parameters

`n` : integer
:   The number of samples in latitude used in the spherical harmonic transform. This must be even.


## Description

`DHaj` will calculate the latitudinal weights used in the spherical harmonic transform of Driscoll and Healy (1994; equation 9). The number of samples `n` must be even, and the transform and its inverse are implemented as `SHExpandDH` and `MakeGridDH`, respectively. It is noted that the first element, corresponding to the north pole, is always zero. The element corresponding to the south pole is not included.
