## Features

* Supports all standard normalizations and phase conventions of the spherical harmonic functions.

* Effortless conversion between real and complex harmonics, between phase conventions, and between 4&pi; normalized, Schmidt semi-normalized, orthonormalized, and unnormalized harmonics.

* Use of both regularly sampled geographic grids and grids appropriate for Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

* Spherical harmonic transforms proven to be fast and accurate.

* Supports multiple backends for performing basic mathematical operations, including [shtools](index-fortran.html) and the [Distinctly Useful Code Collection (DUCC)](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/ducc).

* Perform localized multitaper spectral analyses, or expand functions in terms of localized Slepian basis.

* Supports standard data and file formats, including *xarray* and *netcdf*.

* Import research-grade gravity, topography, and magnetic field datasets with a single command.

* Creation of publication quality maps using [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy) and [pygmt](https://www.pygmt.org/).

## Easy installation

The Python components of SHTOOLS can be installed using the Python package manager `pip` or `conda`. Binaries are pre-built for Linux, macOS and Windows architectures, and you need only to execute one of the following commands in a unix terminal:

```bash
pip install pyshtools
pip install --upgrade pyshtools  # to upgrade a pre-existing installation
conda install -c conda-forge pyshtools  # Linux and macOS only
conda update -c conda-forge pyshtools  # to upgrade a pre-existing installation
```

## Permissive licensing

SHTOOLS is open source software and is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license.
