	<h1>Version History</h1>

	<h2>Version 3.3 (beta)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Added full support for Python 3.</li>
		<li>Fixed a critical, but rare, bug in <tt>MakeGridDH</tt>, <tt>MakeGravGridDH</tt>, <tt>MakeMagGridDH</tt>, and <tt>MakeGravGradGridDH</tt>. In these routines, the rows of the output grid are calculated by inverse Fourier transmforming a vector that depends upon the spherical harmonic coefficients. This vector, when using the complex-to-real FFTW routines, includes one element that corresponds to the coefficients with m=lmax+1. This element of the array was not properly initialized to zero in the Fortran code, and if the Fortran compiler did not explicitly zero all new arrays, this could have resulted in incorrect output. Given that this term is 1 index above the Nyquist frequency (m=lmax), if this element were not zero, each column of the grid would contain a component that oscillates from -1 to +1 (sclaed by the magnitude of the element). Even when this element was not initialized, a subsequent spherical harmonic expansion of the grid would usually give correct results.</li>
		<li>Makefiles were extensively modified to simplify the fortran and python builds: <tt>make all2</tt> and <tt>make all3</tt> were removed and replaced by flags that make use of the precompiler to resolve underscore problems; <tt>make install</tt> now places compiled module files in <tt>/usr/local/includes</tt>.</li>
		<li>Makefiles were improved to minimize problems when installing both <tt>fortran</tt> and <tt>fortran-mp</tt> components. When making the latter, all object and module files in the directory <tt>src</tt> are first deleted.</li>
		<li>Minor modifications to the python example scripts.</li>
		<li>Minor bug fix to the scripts that create the unix <tt>man</tt> documentation.</li>
		<li>Added an <tt>info()</tt> method to shtools constants that prints an info string.</li>
		<li>Add full support for the python classes <tt>SHCoeffs</tt> and <tt>SHGrid</tt>.</li>
		<li>Change python wrapper so that the output arrays in the <tt>SHExpand</tt> routines correspond to the optional input variable <tt>lmax_calc</tt>.</li>
		<li>Created an SHTOOLS development fund, funded by bitcoin donations.</li>
		
	</ul>

	<h2>Version 3.2 (June 20, 2016)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Added the optional argument <tt>centralmeridian</tt> to <tt>Curve2Mask</tt> that accounts for cases where the curve makes a complete circle in longitude about the planet.</li>
		<li>Fixed in bug in the python implementation where the outputs <tt>error</tt> and <tt>corr</tt> of <tt>SHAdmitCorr</tt> were switched.</li>
		<li>Added OpenMP support. When compiling with <tt>make fortran-mp</tt>, <tt>make fortran2-mp</tt>, or <tt>make fortran3-mp</tt>, saved variables in the subroutines are defined as being <tt>threadprivate</tt>.</li>
		<li>Optimized performance of the routines <tt>SHMultiTaperSE</tt>, <tt>SHMultiTaperCSE</tt>, and <tt>SHLocalizedAdmitCorr</tt>.</li>
		<li>Minor documentation fixes.</li>
	</ul>

			<li>Removed the routines <tt>Import_Wisdom_From_File</tt> and <tt>Export_Wisdom_From_File</tt>.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Version 2.9 (August 11, 2014)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Modified <tt>CilmPlus</tt> and <tt>CilmRhoH</tt> so that they are accurate for powers beyond 13.</li>

			<li>Replaced the routine <tt>MakeGravGrid2D</tt> with <tt>MakeGravGridDH</tt>. This routine is orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor, and can calculate all three components of the gravity field and gravity disturbance of the 2190-degree EGM2008 field in under 300 seconds.</li>
			<li> Added the routine <tt>MakeGravGradGridDH</tt> which calculates the components of the gravity "gradient" tensor on a flattened ellipsoid. This routine can calculate the degree-2190 EGM2008 gravity tensor in under 720 seconds.</li>
			<li>Replaced the routine <tt>MakeMagGrid2D</tt> with <tt>MakeMagGridDH</tt>, which is orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor.</li>

			<li>Introduced a different scaling procedure in <tt>CilmPlus</tt> and <tt>CilmRho</tt> that should be more accurate at high powers.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Improved memory management of <tt>CilmPlus</tt> and <tt>Hilm</tt>, avoiding potential runtime crashes at high degrees.</li>
			<li>Added routines <tt>CilmPlusRhoH</tt> and <tt>HilmRhoH</tt> (modified from <tt>CilmPlus</tt> and <tt>Hilm</tt>), which take into account lateral variations in density.</li>
			<li>Improved makefiles, including options to make and run example programs.</li>
			<li>Updated many of the example programs.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Version 2.6 (November 21, 2011)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>ShExpandDH</tt>, <tt>ShExpandDHC</tt>, <tt>ShExpandGLQ</tt>, <tt>ShExpandGLQC</tt>, <tt>MakeGridDH</tt>, <tt>MakeGridDHC</tt>, <tt>MakeGridGLQ</tt>, <tt>MakeGridGLQC</tt> that could have given inaccurate results if called more than twice in a program with the same <tt>N</tt> but different values of <tt>NORM</tt>.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>ShExpandDHC</tt> and <tt>SHExpandGLQC</tt> that could have given rise to a runtime crash or errors in the degree-0 coefficients when called with <tt>LMAX_CALC = 0</tt>.</li>
			<li>Removed routine <tt>SHReadGRACE</tt> and renamed <tt>SHReadCHAMP</tt> to <tt>SHRead2</tt>. <tt>SHRead2</tt> now reads in time derivatives of terms, their epochs, and the starting and ending date of the gravity solution.</li>
			<li>Added the routine <tt>MakeEllipseCoord</tt> for calculating the (lat, long) coordinates of an ellipse placed on a sphere.</li>
			<li>Fixed a major bug in <tt>SHBiasK</tt> that would give wrong answers when <tt>SAVE_CG</tt> was set equal to 1.</li>

			<li>Modified the example code <tt>MarsCrustalThickness</tt> to use Driscoll and Healy sampled grids and to better remove high frequency aliases.</li>
			<li>Improved portability of routines <tt>RandomN</tt> and <tt>RandomGaussian</tt>.</li>

		</ul>
	
	
	<h2>Version 2.5 (August 20, 2009)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the routines <tt>ComputeDMap</tt> and <tt>SHReturnTapersMap</tt> to compute the space-concentration kernel and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for an arbitrary concentration region. The routine <tt>Curve2Mask</tt> can be used to compute a mask of the concentration region given a set of coordinates that specifies a single closed curve.</li>
			<li>Added the optional argument <tt>NORMAL_GRAVITY</tt> to <tt>MakeGravGrid2d</tt> in order to remove the normal gravity from the total gravitational acceleration on the ellipsoid.</li>
			<li>Added routines <tt>SHCilmToVector</tt> and <tt>SHVectorToCilm</tt> for converting between 3D arrays of spherical harmonic coefficients, <tt>Cilm</tt>, and a 1D vector of ordered coefficients. The index corresponding to a given I, L and M can be calculated by <tt>YilmIndex</tt>.</li>
			<li>Added optional parameter <tt>K</tt> to <tt>EigValVecSym</tt> in order to only calculate and return the <tt>K</tt> largest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in <tt>ShExpandDH</tt> and <tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt> that could have given rise to a crash or errors in the degree-0 coefficients when called with <tt>LMAX_CALC = 0</tt>.</li>
			<li>Added the routine <tt>SHBiasAdmitCorr</tt> that calculates the expected localized admittance and correlation functions given the known cross-power spectra of two functions and the power spectra of the localizing windows.</li>
			<li>Added the optional parameter <tt>SAVE_CG</tt> to the routines <tt>SHBias</tt> and <tt>SHBiasK</tt> that allows the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients to be precomputed and saved for future calls.</li>
			<li>Added the optional parameter <tt>MTDEF</tt> to the routine <tt>SHLocalizedAdmitCorr</tt>, allowing the multitaper admittance and correlation to be computed in one of two ways. In the first, the multitaper cross-power spectra are first calculated, and then from these the admittance and correlation. In the second, the admittance and correlation are calculated for each individual taper, and then these are averaged.</li>
			<li>Added the option to use Driscoll-Healy or Gauss-Legendre quadrature grids with the routine <tt>CilmPlus</tt>. It is now necessary to specify the <tt>GRIDTYPE</tt>, and the argument <tt>W</tt> is now optional.</li>
			<li>Added the option <tt>DREF</tt> to <tt>CilmPlus</tt> in order to set the reference radius to calculate the relief and spherical harmonic coefficients. If this parameter is absent, the mean radius of the input grid will be used.</li>
			<li>Reordered the GRIDTYPES in <tt>MakeGeoidGrid</tt> in order to be consistent with <tt>CilmPlus</tt>.</li>
			<li>Fixed two bugs in <tt>SHrtoc</tt> and <tt>SHctor</tt> that only arose when the default value of 0 was explicitly specified for the optional parameter <tt>switchcs</tt>. </li>
			<li>Modified <tt>Wigner3j</tt>, based on the suggestions of Roelof Rietbroek, so that certain unused variables did not get divided by zero.</li>
			<li>Fixed a memory problem in the example code <tt>MarsCrustalThickness</tt> that might have prevented the file from compiling, or to have crashed at runtime.</li>
			<li>Fixed a memory allocation problem that could have caused a runtime crash in <tt>SphericalCapCoef</tt>.</li>
			<li>Removed routines <tt>SHDeltaX</tt> and <tt>SHDeltaL</tt>.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Version 2.4 (May 4, 2008)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added routines <tt>SHExpandDHC</tt>, <tt>MakeGridDHC</tt>, <tt>SHExpandGLQC</tt>, and <tt>MakeGridGLQC</tt> for performing complex spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions.</li>
			<li>Added the optional parameter <tt>CNORM</tt> to the routines <tt>PlmBar</tt>, <tt>PlmBar_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmON</tt>, <tt>PlmON_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmSchmidt</tt>, <tt>PlmSchmidt_d1</tt> and <tt>PreCompute</tt> in order to use the complex normalization.</li>
			<li>Added complex power spectrum routines <tt>SHPowerLC</tt>, <tt>SHPowerDensityLC</tt>, <tt>SHCrossPowerLC</tt>, <tt>SHCrossPowerDensityLC</tt>, <tt>SHPowerSpectrumC</tt>, <tt>SHPowerSpectrumDensityC</tt>, <tt>SHCrossPowerSpectrumC</tt>, and <tt>SHCrossPowerSpectrumDensityC</tt>. </li>
			<li>Fixed bug in <tt>MakeGrid2d</tt>, <tt>MakeMagGrid2d</tt>, and <tt>MakeGravGrid2d</tt> where the optional input of a west boundary was not properly converted to radians, and where 360 degrees was mistakenly added to EAST when EAST was greater than WEST (instead of the converse).</li>
			<li>Added the option to calculate all three components and magnitude of the gravitational field in <tt>MakeGravGrid2D</tt>. The output is now in SI units (as opposed to mGals before), and the radial gravitational acceleration is now positive when directed upwards (as opposed to downwards before).</li>
			<li>Added routines <tt>SHMagPowerL</tt> and <tt>SHMagPowerSpectrum</tt> for computing the power spectrum of the magnetic field given the spherical harmonic coefficients of the magnetic potential.</li>
			<li>Changed routine names of <tt>SHPowerSpectra</tt> to <tt>SHPowerSpectrum</tt>, <tt>SHPowerSpectraDensity</tt> to <tt>SHPowerSpectrumDensity</tt>, <tt>SHCrossPowerSpectra</tt> to <tt>SHCrossPowerSpectrum</tt>, and <tt>SHCrossPowerSpectrumDensity</tt> to <tt>SHCrossPowerSpectrumDensity</tt>.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where the spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions would crash for LMAX=0.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Version 2.3 (October 4, 2007)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Switched the naming convention of source files with a "2" appended at their end. If you previously compiled using <tt>Make all</tt>, you must now use <tt>Make all2</tt>, or vice versa.</li>
			<li> <tt>MakeGrid2D</tt> now requires the optional parameter semi-major axis <tt>A</tt> whenever the optional flattening parameter <tt>F</tt> is specified. Furthermore, the reference ellipsoid is now calculated exactly, instead of just using the degree-2 Legendre expansion coefficient as was done before.</li>
			<li> <tt>MakeGravGrid2D</tt> and <tt>MakeMagGrid2D</tt> now calculate fields on the ellipsoid using exact expressions for the ellipsoid, instead of just the degree-2 Legendre expansion coefficient as was done before. <b>The semi-major axis must now be input, instead of the average planetary radius</b>.</li>
			<li> Added optional parameter <tt>LMAX_CALC</tt> to <tt>MakeGridGLQ</tt> and <tt>MakeGridDH</tt> that specifies the maximum spherical harmonic degree to evaluate the function up to. The required parameter LMAX determines the grid spacing of the output grid, as well as the maximum expansion degree if <tt>LMAX_CALC</tt> is not present.</li>
			<li> Added the optional parameter <tt>LMAX_CALC</tt> to 
			<tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt> and <tt>SHExpandDH</tt> that specifies the maximum degree of the spherical harmonic expansion. <tt>LMAX</tt> determines the grid spacing of the input grids, and corresponds to the maximum degree of the expansion if <tt>LMAX_CALC</tt> is not specified.</li>
			<li> <tt>MakeGeoid2D</tt> has been rewritten and renamed to <tt>MakeGeoidGrid</tt>. This new routine allows one to calculate the geoid using either first, second, or third order approximations, and the map values can be specified on either a 2D Cartesian grid, a Gauss-Legendre quadrature grid, a N by N grid, or a N by 2N grid. The geoid can either be referenced to a flattened ellipsoid, or a spherical interface.</li>
			<li> Fixed an error in the documentation to <tt>SHRotateCoef</tt> and <tt>SHRotateRealCoef</tt>. The rotations use the "y convention" where the second rotation is with respect to the y axis, and not the x axis as was originally stated.</li>
			<li> Added the optional parameters <tt>NORTH</tt>, <tt>SOUTH</tt>, <tt>EAST</tt> and <tt>WEST</tt> to the routines <tt>MakeGrid2D</tt>, <tt>MakeMagGrid2D</tt> and <tt>MakeGravGrid2D</tt> that specifies the maximum and minimum latitudes and longitudes of the output grid.</li>
			<li>Large temporary arrays are now dynamically allocated in order to resolve problems with Absoft ProFortran 10 and stack overflows.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>Version 2.2 (May 20, 2007)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li> Added routine <tt>MakeGravGrid</tt> that will create a map of the radial gravity or potential referenced to a flattened ellipsoid.</li>
			<li> Added routine <tt>SHConfidence</tt> that determines the probability two sets of spherical harmonic coefficients are correlated at a given degree with a given correlation coefficient.</li>
			<li> Added optional parameter <tt>f</tt> to the routine <tt>MakeGrid2D</tt> in order to reference the function to a flattened ellipsoid.</li>
			<li> Added optional parameter <tt>K1LINSIG</tt> to <tt>SHLocalizedAdmitCorr</tt> that allows one to calculate the expected uncertainty of the admittance function using a single localization window. The gravity and topography coefficients are assumed to be related by a linear (degree-dependent) transfer function and that the lack of correlation is a result of uncorrelated noise.</li>
			<li> Added optional argument <tt>CNUM</tt> to <tt>MakeCircleCoord</tt> that gives the number of elements in the output arrays.</li>
			<li> Fixed minor bugs in <tt>PlmSchmidt</tt>, <tt>PlmSchmidt_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmBar</tt>, <tt>PlmBar_d1</tt> and <tt>PlmON_d1</tt> that could have caused runtime crashes under certain circumstances.</li>
			<li> Fixed a minor bug in <tt>MakeGrid2d</tt> that could have caused a runtime crash.</li>
			<li> Fixed a minor bug in <tt>PlmON_d1</tt> that could cause compilation errors.</li>
			<li> Fixed a minor bug in <tt> SHSjkPG</tt> that would cause g95  compiled code to crash at runtime.</li>
			<li> Saved allocated memory in the associated Legendre function routines (<tt>PlmSchmidt</tt>, <tt>PlmSchmidt_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmON</tt>, <tt>PlmON_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmBar</tt>, and <tt>PlmBar_d1</tt>) can be deallocated by calling with a spherical harmonic degree of -1.</li>
			<li> All routines that call associated Legendre functions now deallocate the saved allocated memory.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Version 2.1 (October 20, 2006)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li> Modified <tt>PlmBar</tt>, <tt>PlmBar_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmON</tt>, <tt>PlmON_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmSchmidt</tt> and <tt>PlmSchmidt_d1</tt> to save certain variables that are repeatedly calculated with multiple calls using the same maximum degree.</li>
			<li> <tt>MakeGridDH</tt>, <tt>MakeGridGLQ</tt>, <tt>SHExpandDH</tt>, and <tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt> have been rewritten so that the Legendre functions are computed within these routines, as opposed to being computed externally. This results in a reduction in computation time by a factor of about three to four.</li>
			<li> Added optional argument <tt>sampling</tt> that allows for the calculation of either equally sampled (NxN) and equally spaced (Nx2N) grids.</li>
			<li> Fixed a bug in <tt>MakeGridDH</tt> that would cause this routine to crash if the optional argument <tt>norm</tt> was not specified.</li>
			<li> Fixed <tt>SHMTVarOpt</tt> so that it would calculate all elements of the covariance matrix, not just those where the two tapers had the same value of <i>m</i>.</li>
			<li> Added optional argument <tt>nocross</tt> to <tt>SHMTVarOpt</tt> and <tt>SHMTVarOpt0</tt> in order to calculate only the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix <i>Fij</i>.</li>
			<li> Fixed a bug in <tt>SHReturnTapersM</tt> where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors were wrong when <i>m</i> was not equal to zero.</li>
			<li>Added subroutine <tt>SHMTDebais</tt> that inverts for the global power spectrum given a localized multitaper spectrum estimate.</li>
			<li> Minor tweaks and improved documentation.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
	<h2>Version 2.0.1 (August 7, 2006)</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Updated the FAQ to describe common linking and compilation problems.</li>
			<li> <tt>make all</tt> and <tt>make all2</tt> will compile the source code with and without underscores appended to the LAPACK subroutine names, respectively.</li>
			<li> Created the user group <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/SHTOOLS">SHTOOLS</a> at Google groups. This is probably the best place to look for answers to common problems.</li>
			<li> The optional argument <tt>csphase</tt> was mistakenly declared for the function <tt>PLegendre_d1</tt> instead of <tt>PLegendreA_d1</tt> in the <tt>SHTOOLS.f95</tt> module file. This might have caused <tt>SHReturnTapersM</tt> to crash for <tt>m=0</tt>.</li>
			<li> Fixed a minor bug in the example file <tt>TestExpandDH.f95</tt> that might have caused this program to crash.</li>
			<li> Fixed a minor array allocation problem in <tt>SHBiasK</tt> and <tt>SHBias</tt> that might have caused this routine to crash.</li>
			<li> Added example programs for determining the timing and accuracy of the spherical harmonic transform routines.</li>
			<li> Modified the FFTW wisdom example to only create a wisdom file for a single spherical harmonic degree.</li>
			<li> Minor tweaks.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Version 2.0 (July 21, 2006)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li> Complete man and web based documentation has been written. In addition, all routines now check that the input arrays are dimensioned properly, and output informative errors if this is not the case.</li>
			<li> Subroutines <tt>Cilm_plus</tt> and <tt>DH_aj</tt> have been rename to <tt>CilmPlus</tt> and <tt>DHaj</tt>, respectively.</li>
			<li> <tt>MakeGridCoordGLQ</tt> renamed and completely written as <tt>GLQGridCoord</tt>.</li>
			<li> Subroutine <tt>ShannonNumber</tt> has been removed.</li>
			<li> Arguments of <tt>MakeGridDH</tt> have been reordered.</li>
			<li> Renamed <tt>SHReturnTapers</tt> to <tt>SHReturnTapers0</tt>.</li>
			<li> Renamed <tt>SHReturnAllTapers</tt> to <tt>SHReturnTapers</tt>.</li>
			<li> Added optional argument <tt>NORM</tt> to <tt>SHMultiply</tt>.</li>
		</ul>
			
		
	<h2>Version 1.7 (June 4, 2006)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li> Modified <tt>SHExpandDH</tt>, <tt>MakeGridDH</tt>, <tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt> and <tt>MakeGridGLQ</tt> to make use of the symmetry relationship of Legendre functions about the equator. This leads to an increase in speed by almost a factor of 2 (note that the documentation under the section "Speed" was generated using the old routines).</li>
			<li> Renamed <tt>SHAdmitCoher</tt> to <tt>SHAdmitCorr</tt>.</li>
			<li> Modified <tt>SHDeltaX</tt> to work with non-zonal windows.</li>
			<li> Fixed bug in <tt>SHMultiply</tt> that caused this routine to crash.</li>

			<li> Added functions <tt>SHSjkPG0</tt> and <tt>SHjkPG</tt>.</li>
			<li> Added subroutines <tt>SHMTVarOpt0</tt> and <tt>SHMTVarOpt</tt> for calculating optimal weights and minimum variances of multitaper spectral estimates using zonal and non-zonal tapers, respectively.</li>
			<li> Added subroutine <tt>SHReturnAllTapers</tt> to return all tapers of the spherical cap concentration problem (not just the zonal ones as in <tt>SHReturnTapers</tt>).</li>
			<li> <tt>SHExpandDH</tt> has been modified (as well as the example file <tt>TestExpandDH</tt>) to allow for grids that are N by 2N. This ensures that higher frequencies in longitude are not aliased into lower frequencies when using data expressed on equally spaced grids.</li>
			<li> <b><tt>SHBias</tt> was modified such that the routine now expects as input the window's power spectrum, and NOT the window's coefficients! Furthermore, the routine now assumes (as stated in the program) that the variable <tt>incspectra</tt> is zero beyond <tt>ldata</tt>.</b></li>
			<li> <tt>SHBiasK</tt>, <tt>SHMultiTaperCSE</tt>, <tt>SHMultiTaperSE</tt>, and <tt>SHLocalizedAdmitCorr</tt> have been rewritten to work with non-zonal tapers.</li>
			<li><tt>SHrtoc</tt> and <tt>SHctor</tt> now allow to switch between Condon-Shortley phase conventions.</li>
			<li><tt>SHRotateRealCoef</tt> now checks to see what the default value of the Condon-Shortley phase is before converting the real coefficients to complex form.</li>
			<li> <tt>PLegendreA</tt> and <tt>PLegendreA_d1</tt> have been modified such that the default is to <b>exclude</b> the Condon-Shortley phase of <tt>(-1)<sup>m</sup></tt>.</li>
			<li> All assocaiated Legendre function routines can use the Condon-Shortely phase factor by specifying the optional parameter <tt>csphase=-1</tt>.</li>
			<li> The default Condon-Shortley phase convention can be set at compile time by changeing the variable <tt>CSPHASE_DEFAULT</tt> in <tt>SHTOOLS.f95</tt>.</li>
			<li> Added the optional argument <tt>csphase</tt> to the routines <tt>SHExpandLSQ</tt>, <tt>MakeGridDH</tt>, <tt>SHExpandDH</tt>, <tt>MakeGrid2D</tt>, <tt>MakeGridPoint</tt>, <tt>MakeGridGLQ</tt>, <tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt>, <tt>PreCompute</tt>, <tt>SHMutiTaperCSE</tt>, <tt>SHMultiTaperSE</tt>, and <tt>SHMultiply</tt>. (Nevertheless, <tt>MakeMagGrid2D</tt>, <tt>MakeGeoid2D</tt>, <tt>Hilm</tt>, and <tt>Cilm_Plus</tt> never use the Condon-Shortely phase, regardless of what the default value is.)</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Version 1.6 (November 12, 2005)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li> SHTOOLS is now copyrighted according to the terms of the revised BSD license.</li>
			<li> Added "ortho-normalized" Legendre functions <tt>PlmON</tt>, <tt>PlmON_d1</tt>, <tt>PlON</tt>, and <tt>PlON_d1</tt>.</li>
			<li> Added subroutine <tt>SHReadCHAMP</tt> and <tt>SHReadGRACE</tt> that reads CHAMP and GRACE formatted spherical harmonic files, respectively.</li>
			<li> Fixed bug in routines <tt>SHrtoc</tt> and <tt>SHctor</tt> when the optional parameter <tt>convention</tt> was set equal to 2. This case was never used in previous versions of <tt>SHTOOLS</tt>.</li>
			<li> More constants have been added to the module <tt>Planets_Const</tt>.</li>
			<li> Added subroutine <tt>MakeGeoid2D</tt> that will create a 2D equally spaced grid of the geoid, calculated to second order, that includes the pseudo-rotational potential.</li>
			<li> <b>Fixed a bug in <tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt> and <tt>SHExpandDH</tt> that only concerned the degree-0 term when using Schmidt-normalized harmonics</b>.</li>
			<li> <b>Fixed a bug in <tt>SHExpandDH</tt> that gave meaningless results for very last degree of the spherical harmonic coefficients.</b></li>
		</ul>
		
	<h2>Version 1.5 (October 7, 2005)</h2>
	
		<ul>
			<li><tt>PlmBar</tt>, <tt>PlmBar_d1</tt>, <tt>PlmSchmidt</tt>, and <tt>PlmSchmidt_d1</tt> have been rewritten in order to give more accurate results for large <tt>m</tt> near the poles. The square roots of the integers are also precomputed leading to an increase in speed of about a factor of two.</li>
			<li> Added documentation concerning the accuracy and speed of the routines.</li>
			<li> Added make files to create a static archive of the compiled routines.</li>
			<li> Added optional argument <tt>chi2</tt> to <tt>SHExpandLSQ</tt>, which is the residual sum of squares misfit for an overdetermined inversion.</li>

			<li> Added subroutine <tt>SHReadJPL</tt> that reads JPL formatted spherical harmonic files.</li>
			<li> Modified <tt>SHExpandDH</tt> so that it takes up much less memory when working with large spherical harmonic degrees.</li>
			<li> Modified <tt>PreCompute</tt>, <tt>SHExpandGLQ</tt>, <tt>MakeGridGLQ</tt>, <tt>Cilm_Plus</tt>, <tt>Hilm</tt>, and <tt>SHMultiply</tt>, as well as the example files <tt>MarsCrustalThickness</tt> and <tt>TestExpandGLQ</tt>, such that the array <tt>plx</tt> is optional. When working with large spherical harmonic degrees, this array takes up a lot of memory and should not be precomputed. If this array is not specified when calling the subroutine, then the optional array <tt>zero</tt> (obtained from <tt>PreCompute</tt>) must be specified instead.</li>
