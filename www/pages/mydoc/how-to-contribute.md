## I would like to contribute to the code base

The easiest way to contribute to developing SHTOOLS is by GitHub.

* Start by forking the [SHTOOLS](https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS) repo into your GitHub account.
* Clone this repo on your local computer.
* Commit changes to your personal repo. We work on the "develop" branch, so please base your commits based on the most recent commit on this branch.
* When you think that your changes are ready to be incorporated into the main repo, make a pull request, describing what you changed and why. 
* The administrators will verify your work and may ask for changes. After they are happy with your contribution, they will merge your pull request into the main repo.

If you are not comfortable with using git, please just contact us by email. We will be happy to help.

## I would like to report a bug, or suggest a change

* If you find a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/issues) on GitHub.
* If you would like to suggest a change, or suggest a new feature that should be implemented in SHTOOLS, please open an [issue](https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/issues) at the same place. Before doing so, please look at the SHTOOLS [milestones](https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/milestones) to see if this is already on the development roadmap.

## I would like to fix some typos in the documentation

* The easiest way to suggest a change to the documentation is to find the file on GitHub and modify it by clicking on the edit button. Then just follow the instructions for opening a pull request. This is really very easy, and it is impossible to mess anything up.
