	<h2><a name="g1"></a>Who maintains SHTOOLS?</h2>

	<p>This software package was created in 2004 by <a href="https://github.com/MarkWieczorek">Mark Wieczorek</a>, who is the lead Fortran 95 developer. As of version 3.0, <a href="https://github.com/MatthiasMeschede">Matthias Meschede</a> is the lead Python developer. We can be contacted at the <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS">SHTOOLS GitHub organization page</a>. </p>

	<h2><a name="g2"></a>I have a question.</h2>

	<p>Before contacting us, first (1) read the page <a href="install.html">Compilation Instructions</a>, (2) read the sections <a href="using-f95.html">Using SHTOOLS with Fortran 95</a> and <a href="using-python.html">Python</a>, (3) read this FAQ, (4) ensure that you are using the current version of SHTOOLS, (5) perform a <tt>make clean</tt> and recompile SHTOOLS, and finally (6) consult the <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/issues">SHTOOLS issues at GitHub</a>. </p>

	<p>If at this point your problem is not resolved, for most cases we would prefer that you open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/issues">GitHub</a>. You can also contact the developers by email.</p>

	<h2><a name="g2b"></a>I have a suggestion.</h2>

	<p>We often make improvements based on user suggestions. Nevertheless, please realize that the developers are very busy and that we are not paid to develop or maintain this archive. We suggest that you open an issue on GitHub describing your suggestion, and we will then flag the issue as a future enhancement.</p>

	<h2><a name="g3"></a>I would like to contribute.</h2>

	<p>The easiest way to contribute to developing SHTOOLS is by GitHub. Start by forking the SHTOOLS repo into your GitHub account, and then clone this repo on your local computer. Commit changes to your personal repo, and when you think that your changes are ready to be incorporated into the main code, make a pull request.</p>

	<p>Another way to contribute is by filing GitHub issues when you find a bug, and to respond to open issues if you have an answer.</p>	

	<h2><a name="g4"></a>Can I use the SHTOOLS library with C, F77, and Matlab?</h2>

	<p>Probably. If you get this to work, let us know how you did it and we will add the instructions and source files to the distribution.</p>


	<h2><a name="g6"></a>How do I cite SHTOOLS in a publication?</h2>

	<p>SHTOOLS has a DOI (digital object identifier) at <a href="http://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>. The suggested way to cite SHTOOLS is given on the <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/releases">GitHub SHTOOLS release page</a>.</p>

	<p>If you are using a routine that is based on a published algorithm, then you should reference the appropriate publication that is cited in the man pages.</p>

	<h2><A name="g7"></a>Where can I find more information about spherical harmonics?</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">Two good online resources are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalHarmonic.html">Mathworld - Spherical Harmonic</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics">Wikipedia - Spherical harmonics</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2><A name="g8"></a>Will you help me with my homework?</h2>

	<p>No.</p>

	<h2><A name="g9"></a>I don't understand Fortran and Python. Will you explain how to modify the example codes?</h2>

	<p>No.</p>

	<h2><A name="g10"></a>How do I make images with the output from SHTOOLS?</h2>

	<p>If you are using the Fortran version of SHTOOLS, the output is typically in the form of an ASCII raster file. These can be read by any standard graphics package, such as the free unix-based command line software <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/">GMT</a>.</p>

	<p>If you are using the Python version of SHTOOLS, the output can be visualized by use of the <tt>matplotlib</tt> package.</p>

	<h2><A name="g11"></a>SHTOOLS developer fund</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">If you would like to help support the continued developement of SHTOOLS, please consider donating bitcoin to the developer fund at:</p>

<p class="indent nomarginbot">BTC: 139oAA4fDSjX8y8ZpTUecXomosYb1HJ9SR</p>

	<p>Donated funds will be used for several purposes, including web hosting, web development, and bounties for specific tasks.</p>

	<h2><a name="c1"></a>SHTOOLS won't compile on my computer.</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">If the command <tt>make fortran</tt> (or <tt>make fortran-mp</tt>) results in compilation errors</p>

	<ol>
		<li> Verify that you have the latest release of SHTOOLS.</li>
		<li> Perform a <tt>make clean</tt> and try again.</li>
		<li> Go to the <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/issues">SHTOOLS issues at GitHub</a> to see if this problem has already been documented.</li>
		<li> Open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/issues">SHTOOLS project at GitHub</a>. Please include the <b>entire</b> output generated by the Makefile, along with information on the operating system and compilers that you are using.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
	If you are having problems linking an already compiled SHTOOLS library to your code, see the "linking problems" below. If you are instead receiving compilation errors in <i>your</i> code, only contact us after you have thoroughly debugged your program. If you are receiving non fatal warnings, please let us know so that we can clean up the relevant code.</p>

	<h2><A name="c2"></a>Can I compile SHTOOLS with Fortran 77?</h2>

	<p>No, you must use a fortran 90/95 compiler. Two free Fortran 90/95 compilers are <tt>gfortran</tt> (as part of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>) and <a href="http://www.g95.org/">g95</a>. If you will be using the Python code, it will be easiest to use the <tt>gfortran</tt> compiler.</p>

	<h2><a name="l1"></a>Linking fails because of "Undefined symbols".</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">Linking your program to the SHTOOLS and LAPACK libraries might result in an error similar to the following:</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
	ld: Undefined symbols:<br>
	_dgels<br>
	../../lib/libSHTOOLS.a(SHExpandLSQ.o) reference to undefined _dgels<br>
	link failed.</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">If the linker is correctly finding the LAPACK and FFTW libraries, the most likely cause of this is that the subroutine names in the SHTOOLS, LAPACK, and FFTW libraries are not exactly the same. If SHTOOLS is able to link to the FFTW library correctly, but not LAPACK, try rebuilding SHTOOLS using</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
		make clean<br>
		make fortran LAPACK_UNDERSCORE=1</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">If a similar problem is arising with the FFTW libraries, use</p>
	
	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
		make clean<br>
		make fortran FFTW_UNDERSCORE=1</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>These commands will compile SHTOOLS source files that append explicitly underscores to either the LAPACK of FFTW subroutine names. If you get similar link errors, but with an added underscore, this probably means that the linker can't find the LAPACK library. See also <a href="#l4">How do I know if I need to append underscores to external function and subroutine names?</a></p>

	<h2><a name="l2"></a>Linking fails because e_wsfe, z_abs, c_sqrt, s_cmp, etc., are undefined.</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">Linking your program to the SHTOOLS, LAPACK, BLAS, and FFTW libraries might result in link errors similar to:</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `e_wsfe'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `z_abs'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `c_sqrt'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `s_cmp'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `z_exp'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `c_exp'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `do_fio'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `z_sqrt'<br>

	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `c_abs'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `s_wsfe'<br>
	/usr/lib///liblapack.so: undefined reference to `s_copy'
	</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">This can arise when the offending libraries were built using the g77 compiler. In order to rectify this, it should only be necessary to link to the additional library <tt>libg2c.a</tt> (i.e., g77 to c). Assuming that this library can be found by the linker, just append <tt>-lg2c</tt> to the list of libraries passed to the linker. If the <tt>g2c</tt> libary can not be found by the linker, an easy way to find its location is by using either the "locate" or "find" shell commands</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	<tt> locate libg2c.a<br>
	find /usr -name libg2c.a</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">where the find command searches the directory <tt>/usr</tt>. This pathname can then be added to the linker's search path by using the option <tt>-Ldirname</tt>, by, for example,</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
	-L/usr/lib/gcc/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.4.3 -lg2c</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2><a name="l2a"></a>Linking fails because of undefined references to SHTOOLS routines.</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">For some compilers, the location of the source file following the compiler name is important. When this is the case, if the source file is not in its correct position, you could receive link errors that resemble the following:</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	gfortran -L../lib -lSHTOOLS TimingAccuracy/TimingAccuracyGLQC.f95 -I../modules/ -L../lib -lfftw3 -lm -m64 -O3 -o TimingAccuracy/TimingAccuracyGLQC<br>
/tmp/cchgdOpg.o: In function `MAIN__':<br>
TimingAccuracyGLQC.f95:(.text+0x5b3): undefined reference to `randomgaussian_'<br>
TimingAccuracyGLQC.f95:(.text+0xb9b): undefined reference to `shglq_'<br>
TimingAccuracyGLQC.f95:(.text+0xd39): undefined reference to `makegridglqc_'<br>
TimingAccuracyGLQC.f95:(.text+0xedd): undefined reference to `shexpandglqc_'<br>
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status<br></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">For this example, successful compilation can be achieved by placing the source file before the library calls:</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	gfortran  TimingAccuracy/TimingAccuracyGLQC.f95 -L../lib -lSHTOOLS2.8 -I../modules/ -L../lib -lfftw3 -lm -m64 -O3 -o TimingAccuracy/TimingAccuracyGLQC</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2><a name="l3"></a>The linker can't seem to find either the LAPACK, BLAS, or FFTW libraries.</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">The linker <tt>ld</tt> generally searches for libraries in the directories <tt>/lib</tt>, <tt>/usr/lib</tt> and <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt>. When passing <tt>-lname</tt> to the linker, it will search for the filename <tt>libname.a</tt> in these directories. Additional directories can be added to the search path by passing one or more <tt>-Ldirname</tt> to the linker. For instance, to link to the library <tt>/Users/Me/Lapack/liblapack.a</tt> you would pass the following to the linker</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	<tt>-L/Users/Me/Lapack -llapack</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">If you do not know the location of a given library, it can be easily found using either the "locate" or "find" shell commands</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	<tt> locate lapack.a<br>
	find /usr -name lapack.a</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>where the find command searches the directory <tt>/usr</tt>.</p>

	<p> Note that the LAPACK and BLAS library names might be somewhat different than assumed in this documentation. For instance, the LAPACK and BLAS libraries might be invoked by passing <tt>-llapack3</tt>, <tt>-lf77BLAS</tt>, or <tt>-lcblas</tt> to the linker. Note that if the library ATLAS is present, it can be substituted for the BLAS library. If you are certain that the library exists, and that the linker is attempting to link to it, then see <a href="#l4">How do I know if I need to append underscores to external function and subroutine names?</a></p>

	<h2><a name="l4"></a>How do I know if I need to append underscores to external function and subroutine names?</h2>

	<p>When making libraries such as SHTOOLS, LAPACK and FFTW, some compilers by default add trailing underscores to external function and subroutine names. If the function and subroutine names in the SHTOOLS library do not correspond exactly to what is in the LAPACK and FFTW libraries, the linker will not be able to resolve all of the symbols, and you will receive a linker "undefined symbols" error. Most compilers have options that allows you to "modify" the name of the subroutine and function name by specifying arguments such as "fold external function names to lower case", "do not append trailing underscores to external function names", and so on.</p>

	<p class="nomarginbot">If you are certain that you have installed correctly the FFTW, LAPACK and BLAS libraries, and that the linker can indeed find them, then it is quite possible that a linking problem is related to a trailing underscore being present in the external library, but not in the function and subroutine names in the SHTOOLS library (or vice versa). It is simple to inspect these libraries to determine the underscoring convections. For instance, the unix command "display name list"</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	<tt> nm -j libSHTOOLS.a | grep makegridglq</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">yields</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
	_makegridglq_<br>
	_makegridglq_<br>
	_makegridglq_<br>
	_makegridglq_<br>
	_makegridglqc_<br>
	</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Indicating that underscores were added to the SHTOOLS subroutine names.</p>

	<p class="nomarginbot">The command</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	<tt> nm -j /Applications/Absoft13.0/lib/liblapack.a | grep dgels</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">yields</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
	/Applications/Absoft/lib/liblapack.a(dgels.o):<br>
	_dgels_<br>
	/Applications/Absoft/lib/liblapack.a(dgelsd.o):<br>
	_dgelsd_<br>
	/Applications/Absoft/lib/liblapack.a(dgelss.o):<br>
	_dgelss_<br>
	/Applications/Absoft/lib/liblapack.a(dgelsx.o):<br>
	_dgelsx_<br>
	/Applications/Absoft/lib/liblapack.a(dgelsy.o):<br>
	_dgelsy_
	</tt></p>
	 </blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">indicating that trailing underscores where also appended to the LAPACK subroutine names. However, the command</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>
	<tt> nm -j /usr/local/lib/libfftw3.a | grep dfftw_plan_dft_r2c_1d</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p class="nomarginbot">might yield</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
	nm: no name list<br>
	_dfftw_plan_dft_r2c_1d</tt></p>
	 </blockquote>

	<p>indicating that trailing underscores were not appended to the FFTW subroutine names. It is this discrepancy between the FFTW and LAPACK libraries that could make it difficult to link to both simultaneously. To resolve this issue, see <a href="#l1">Linking fails because of "Undefined symbols"</a>.</p>

	<h2><a name="l5"></a>Linking fails because SHTOOLS routines are undefined.</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot">Linking your program to the SHTOOLS library might result in errors such as</p>

	<blockquote><p><tt>
	TestSHRotate.f95:(.text+0xdb6): undefined reference to `makegrid2d'</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The most likely source of this error is that the SHTOOLS library was compiled with a different set of options than used when compiling your program. In particular, it is necessary to use the same compiler options that relate to the naming of external names, such as "fold to lower case" and the appending of underscrores.</p>

	<h2><a name="r1"></a>I get a "segmentation fault" when running a program that links to the SHTOOLS library.</h2>
	<p class="nomarginbot">If the error is related to SHTOOLS, and not your code, then there are a few possible ways to fix this. One possibility is that this problem is related to memory allocation and stack overflows. First, try recompiling your code with the option <tt>-s</tt>. This will try to allocate dynamic arrays in the dataspace, as opposed to the stack. Second, try increasing the stacksize by typing</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
		limit stacksize unlimited
		</tt></p>
	</blockquote>	

	<p class="nomarginbot">at the unix prompt. If this works, consider adding this to your default shell initialization file. Finally, try increasing the datasize by typing</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p><tt>
		limit datasize unlimited
		</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2><a name="r2"></a>My program crashes when calling SHTOOLS routines.</h2>
	<p class="nomarginbot">If your program still crashes after making the above modifications, then try the following:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Read the version history to make certain that you are aware of any recent modifications. </li>
		<li>Verify that you have enough memory to perform the calculations. Be aware that some routines dynamically allocate arrays.</li>
		<li>Verify that the documentation describing the routine is correct by (1) comparing the man pages with the intent and argument ordering in the interface block of the file <tt>SHTOOLS.f95</tt>, and (2) reading the documentation in the actual source code.  </li>
		<li>Try recompiling the SHTOOLS library <i>without</i> using optimization, i.e., by removing the fortran flag <tt>-Ox</tt>.</li>
		<li>Use a debugger to find out where the error is occurring.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>If this all fails, then let us know which routine is involved, as well as the error message you encounter. Any debugging that is done on your part will help greatly in finding the problem. Be aware that we are not being paid to solve your problems.</p>

	<h2><a name="r3"></a>How do I specify "optional" parameters in functions and subroutines?</h2>

	<p> In Fortran 95, this can be specified in one of two ways. First, if there is only one possible optional parameter, it is only necessary to include (or exclude) it at the end of the list of arguments. In contrast, if more than one optional parameter is allowed, it is necessary to use the syntax <tt>OPTIONALVARIABLENAME=variable</tt> at the end of the list of calling arguments. It is strongly suggested that you always directly specify the name of the optional parameter, because it is quite possible that additional optional parameters will be added at a later date.</p>

	<h2><a name="r4"></a>The LAPACK routine DSTEGR crashes with an arithmetic exception.</h2>

	<p class="nomarginbot"> The LAPACK routine DSTEGR is used to obtain the eigenvalues of a symmetric real tridiagonal matrix. Normal execution of this routine may generate infinities and NANs that are properly treated by ieee-754 floating point standards. If this routine crashes with the message</p>

	<blockquote><p>
	<tt>*** Arithmetic exception:  - aborting<br>
	Aborted</tt></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>the LAPACK library was most likely not compiled using full ieee-754 standards. Try recompiling LAPACK with a compiler option such as <tt>-ieee=full</tt>.</p>
