The spherical harmonic degree where the filter is equal to 0.5.
.TP
\f[V]r\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The reference radius of the gravitational field.
.TP
\f[V]d\f[R] : input, real(dp)

.SH Description
.PP
\f[V]DownContFilterMC\f[R] will calculate a minimum-curvature downward
continuation filter for a given spherical harmonic degree \f[V]l\f[R].
The input parameters include \f[V]half\f[R], which is the degree where
the filter is equal to 0.5, and \f[V]r\f[R] and \f[V]d\f[R], which are
the reference radius of the gravitational field and the radius of the
surface to downward continue to, respectively.
.PP
A simple analytic expression exists for the downward continuation
filter, following the methodology of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998), only
when taking the first, third, fifth, and so on, derivatives of their
equation 17.
For this minimum-curvature filter, which corresponds to the second
derivative, the form has simply been generalized using the solutions of
the odd derivatives.
This may or may not turn out to be exact.
In any case, the form of this filter is numerically very similar to the
Cartesian minimum-curvature filter of Phipps Morgan and Blackman (1993).
