\f[CR]a\f[R], \f[CR]f\f[R], \f[CR]vxx\f[R], \f[CR]vyy\f[R],

.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[CR]cilm\f[R] : input, real(dp), dimension (2, \f[CR]lmax\f[R]+1, \f[CR]lmax\f[R]+1)
The real Schmidt semi\-normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of the
magnetic potential.
The coefficients \f[CR]c1lm\f[R] and \f[CR]c2lm\f[R] refer to the cosine
and sine coefficients, respectively, with
\f[CR]c1lm=cilm(1,l+1,m+1)\f[R] and \f[CR]c2lm=cilm(2,l+1,m+1)\f[R].
The coefficients are assumed to have units of nT.
.TP
\f[CR]lmax\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients
\f[CR]cilm\f[R].
This determines the number of samples of the output grids,
\f[CR]n=2lmax+2\f[R], and the latitudinal sampling interval,
\f[CR]90/(lmax+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]r0\f[R]: input, real(dp)
The reference radius of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
.TP
\f[CR]a\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The semi\-major axis of the flattened ellipsoid on which the field is
computed.
.TP
\f[CR]f\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The flattening of the reference ellipsoid:
\f[CR]f=(R_equator\-R_pole)/R_equator\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]vxx\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D map of the \f[CR]xx\f[R] component of the magnetic field tensor
that conforms to the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994).
If \f[CR]sampling\f[R] is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is
dimensioned as (\f[CR]n\f[R] by \f[CR]n\f[R]), where \f[CR]n\f[R] is
\f[CR]2lmax+2\f[R].
If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as
(\f[CR]n\f[R] by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal sampling interval is 180/\f[CR]n\f[R] degrees, and the
default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first
longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the longitudinal band
for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal sampling interval is
360/\f[CR]n\f[R] for an equally sampled and 180/\f[CR]n\f[R] for an
equally spaced grid, respectively.
If \f[CR]extend\f[R] is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the
latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the
dimensions of the grid by 1.
.TP
\f[CR]vyy\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[CR]yy\f[R]
component of the magnetic field tensor.
.TP
\f[CR]vzz\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong))
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[CR]zz\f[R]
component of the magnetic field tensor.
.TP
\f[CR]vxy\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[CR]xy\f[R]
component of the magnetic field tensor.
.TP
\f[CR]vxz\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[CR]xz\f[R]
component of the magnetic field tensor.
.TP
\f[CR]vyz\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the YZ component of the
magnetic field tensor.
.TP
\f[CR]n\f[R] : output, integer(int32)
The number of samples in latitude of the output grids.
This is equal to \f[CR]2lmax+2\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]sampling\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32), default = 1
If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (\f[CR]n\f[R] by
\f[CR]n\f[R]).
If 2, the grids are equally spaced (\f[CR]n\f[R] by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]).
.TP
\f[CR]lmax_calc\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions.
This must be less than or equal to \f[CR]lmax\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]extend\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
If 1, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of \f[CR]griddh\f[R] by
1.
.TP
\f[CR]exitstatus\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
\f[CR]MakeMagGradGridDH\f[R] will create 2\-dimensional cylindrical maps
from the spherical harmonic coefficients \f[CR]cilm\f[R], equally
sampled (\f[CR]n\f[R] by \f[CR]n\f[R]) or equally spaced (\f[CR]n\f[R]
by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]) in latitude and longitude, for six components of the
magnetic field tensor (all using geocentric coordinates):
.PP
\f[CR](Vxx,  Vxy,  Vxz)\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR](Vyx,  Vyy,  Vyz)\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR](Vzx,  Vzy,  Vzz)\f[R]
.PP
The reference frame is north\-oriented, where \f[CR]x\f[R] points north,
\f[CR]y\f[R] points west, and \f[CR]z\f[R] points upward (all tangent or
perpendicular to a sphere of radius r).
The magnetic potential is defined as
.PP
\f[CR]V = r0 Sum_{l=0}\(halmax (r0/r)\(ha(l+1) Sum_{m=\-l}\(hal C_{lm} Y_{lm}\f[R],
.PP
where \f[CR]r0\f[R] is the reference radius of the spherical harmonic
coefficients \f[CR]Clm\f[R], and the vector magnetic field is
.PP
\f[CR]B = \- Grad V\f[R].
.PP
The magnetic field tensor is symmetric, and satisfies
\f[CR]Vxx+Vyy+Vzz=0\f[R], though all three diagonal elements are
calculated independently in this routine.
.PP
The components of the magnetic field tensor are calculated according to
eq.
1 in Petrovskaya and Vershkov (2006), which is based on eq.
3.28 in Reed (1973) (noting that Reed\(cqs equations are in terms of
latitude and that the \f[CR]y\f[R] axis points east):
.PP
\f[CR]Vzz = Vrr\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]Vxx = 1/r Vr + 1/r\(ha2 Vtt\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]Vyy = 1/r Vr + 1/r\(ha2 /tan(t) Vt + 1/r\(ha2 /sin(t)\(ha2 Vpp\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]Vxy = 1/r\(ha2 /sin(t) Vtp \- cos(t)/sin(t)\(ha2 /r\(ha2 Vp\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]Vxz = 1/r\(ha2 Vt \- 1/r Vrt\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[CR]Vyz = 1/r\(ha2 /sin(t) Vp \- 1/r /sin(t) Vrp\f[R]
.PP
where \f[CR]r\f[R], \f[CR]t\f[R], \f[CR]p\f[R] stand for radius, theta,
and phi, respectively, and subscripts on \f[CR]V\f[R] denote partial
derivatives.
.PP
The output grid are in units of nT / m and are cacluated on a flattened
ellipsoid with semi\-major axis \f[CR]a\f[R] and flattening
\f[CR]f\f[R].
The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on
the ellipsoid are greater than the maximum radius of the planet (the
potential coefficients are simply downward/upward continued in the
spectral domain).
.PP
The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled
(\f[CR]n\f[R] by \f[CR]n\f[R]), but this can be changed to use an
equally spaced grid (\f[CR]n\f[R] by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]) by the optional
argument \f[CR]sampling\f[R].
The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying
the optional argument \f[CR]extend\f[R].
