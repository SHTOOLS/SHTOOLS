.SH MakeGridDHC

theorem.
.SH Usage
call MakeGridDHC (\f[CR]griddh\f[R], \f[CR]n\f[R], \f[CR]cilm\f[R],
\f[CR]lmax\f[R], \f[CR]norm\f[R], \f[CR]sampling\f[R],
\f[CR]csphase\f[R], \f[CR]lmax_calc\f[R], \f[CR]extend\f[R],
\f[CR]exitstatus\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[CR]griddh\f[R] : output, complex(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D complex map of the input spherical harmonic coefficients
\f[CR]cilm\f[R] that conforms to the sampling theorem of Driscoll and
Healy (1994).
If \f[CR]sampling\f[R] is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is
dimensioned as (\f[CR]n\f[R] by \f[CR]n\f[R]), where \f[CR]n\f[R] is
\f[CR]2lmax+2\f[R].
If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as
(\f[CR]n\f[R] by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal sampling interval is 180/\f[CR]n\f[R] degrees, and the
default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first
longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the longitudinal band
for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal sampling interval is
360/\f[CR]n\f[R] for an equally sampled and 180/\f[CR]n\f[R] for an
equally spaced grid, respectively.
If \f[CR]extend\f[R] is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the
latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the
dimensions of the grid by 1.
.TP
\f[CR]n\f[R] : output, integer(int32)
The number of samples of the grid, which is equal to \f[CR]2lmax+2\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]cilm\f[R] : input, complex(dp), dimension (2, \f[CR]lmax\f[R]+1, \f[CR]lmax\f[R]+1)
The complex spherical harmonic coefficients of the function.
The first index specifies the coefficient corresponding to the positive
and negative order of \f[CR]m\f[R], respectively, with
\f[CR]Clm=cilm(1,l+1,m+1)\f[R] and \f[CR]Cl,\-m=cilm(2,l+1,m+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]lmax\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the function.
This determines the number of samples \f[CR]n\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]norm\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 1
1 (default) = 4\-pi (geodesy) normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt
semi\-normalized harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal
harmonics.
.TP
\f[CR]sampling\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 1
If 1 (default) the input grid is equally sampled (\f[CR]n\f[R] by
\f[CR]n\f[R]).
If 2, the grid is equally spaced (\f[CR]n\f[R] by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]).
.TP
\f[CR]csphase\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 1
1 (default) = do not apply the Condon\-Shortley phase factor to the
associated Legendre functions; \-1 = append the Condon\-Shortley phase
factor of (\-1)\(ham to the associated Legendre functions.
.TP
\f[CR]lmax_calc\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = \f[CR]lmax\f[R]
The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the function.
This must be less than or equal to \f[CR]lmax\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]extend\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
If 1, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of \f[CR]griddh\f[R] by
1.
.TP
\f[CR]exitstatus\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
\f[CR]MakeGridDHC\f[R] will create a 2\-dimensional complex map equally
sampled (\f[CR]n\f[R] by \f[CR]n\f[R]) or equally spaced (\f[CR]n\f[R]
by \f[CR]2n\f[R]) in latitude and longitude from a set of input complex
spherical harmonic coefficients, where N is \f[CR]2lmax+2\f[R].
This grid conforms with the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy
(1994) and this routine is the inverse of \f[CR]SHExpandDHC\f[R].
The function is evaluated at each longitudinal band by inverse Fourier
transforming the exponential terms for each degree \f[CR]l\f[R], and
then summing over all degrees.
When evaluating the function, the maximum spherical harmonic degree that
is considered is the minimum of \f[CR]lmax\f[R], the size of
\f[CR]cilm\-1\f[R], or \f[CR]lmax_calc\f[R] (if specified).
.PP
The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled
(\f[CR]n\f[R] by \f[CR]n\f[R]), but this can be changed to use an
equally spaced grid (\f[CR]n\f[R] by 2\f[CR]n\f[R]) by the optional
argument \f[CR]sampling\f[R].
The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying
the optional argument \f[CR]extend\f[R].
The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon\-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments \f[CR]norm\f[R] and
\f[CR]csphase\f[R]; if not set, the default is to use geodesy 4\-pi
normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase of
(\-1)\(ham.
.PP
The normalized legendre functions are calculated using the scaling
algorithm of Holmes and Featherstone (2002), which are accurate to about
degree 2800.
The unnormalized functions are accurate only to about degree 15.
