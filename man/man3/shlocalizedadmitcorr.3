correlation functions.
.TP

linear degree-dependent transfer function and that the lack of

error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[V]SHLocalizedAdmitCorr\f[R] will calculate the localized admittance
and degree correlation spectra of two functions at a given location.
The windowing functions are solutions to the spherical-cap concentration
problem (as calculated by \f[V]SHReturnTapers\f[R] or
\f[V]SHReturnTapersM\f[R]), of which the best \f[V]k\f[R] concentrated
tapers are utilized.
If \f[V]k\f[R] is greater than 1, then estimates of the standard error
for the admittance and correlation will be returned in the optional
arrays \f[V]admit_error\f[R] and \f[V]corr_error\f[R].
The symmetry axis of the localizing windows are rotated to the
coordinates (\f[V]lat\f[R], \f[V]lon\f[R]) before performing the
windowing operation.
.PP
The admittance is defined as \f[V]Sgt/Stt\f[R], where \f[V]Sgt\f[R] is
the localized cross-power spectrum of two functions \f[V]G\f[R] and
\f[V]T\f[R] expressed in spherical harmonics.
The localized degree-correlation spectrum is defined as
\f[V]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg Stt)\f[R], which can possess values between -1 and 1.
Two methods are available for calculating the multitaper admittance and
correlation functions.
When \f[V]mtdef\f[R] is 1 (default), the multitaper estimates and errors
of Sgt, Stt, and Sgg are calculated by calls to \f[V]SHMultiTaperSE\f[R]
and \f[V]SHMultiTaperCSE\f[R], and these results are then used to
calculate the final admittance and correlation functions.
When \f[V]mtdef\f[R] is 2, the admitance and correlation are calculated
invidivually for each individual taper, and these results are then
averaged.
.PP
If the optional parameter \f[V]k1linsig\f[R] is specified, and only a
single taper is being used, the uncertainty in the admittance function
will be calculated by assuming the two sets of coefficients are related
by a linear degree-dependent transfer function and that the lack of
correlation is a result of uncorrelated noise.
.PP
When \f[V]mtdef\f[R] is 1, by default, the multitaper spectral estimates
are calculated as an unweighted average of the individual tapered
estimates.
However, if the optional argument \f[V]taper_wt\f[R] is specified, a
weighted average will be employed using the weights in this array.
Minimum variance optimal weights can be obtained from the routines
\f[V]SHMTVarOpt\f[R] if the form of the underlying global power spectrum
is known.
Taper weights can not be used when \f[V]mtdef\f[R] is 2
.PP
This routine assumes that the input functions and tapers are expressed
using geodesy 4-pi normalized spherical harmonic functions that exclude
the Condon-Shortley phase factor of (-1)\[ha]m.
