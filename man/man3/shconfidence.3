.SH SHConfidence
Compute the probability that two functions are correlated at a given
spherical harmonic degree for a given correlation coefficient.
.SH Usage
\f[CR]prob\f[R] = SHConfidence (\f[CR]l\f[R], \f[CR]corr\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[CR]prob\f[R] : output, real(dp)
Probability that two functions expressed in spherical coefficients with
spectral correlation \f[CR]corr\f[R] are correlated at degree
\f[CR]l\f[R].
.TP
\f[CR]l\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The spherical harmonic degree.
.TP
\f[CR]corr\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The correlation coefficient of the two data sets at degree \f[CR]l\f[R].
.SH Description
\f[CR]SHConfidence\f[R] will calculate the probability (between 0 and 1)
that two sets of spherical harmonic coefficients with spectral
correlation \f[CR]corr\f[R] are linearly correlated at a given degree.
This is calculated using equation A7 from Pauer et al.\ (2006).
