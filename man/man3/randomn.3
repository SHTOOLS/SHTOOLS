.SH RandomN
Return a pseudo uniform random deviate between 0 and 1 using the
algorithm of Park and Miller with a Marsaglia shift sequence.
.SH Usage
\f[CR]rn\f[R] = RandomN (\f[CR]seed\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[CR]rn\f[R] : output, real(dp)
The uniform random deviate.
.TP
\f[CR]seed\f[R] : input/output, integer(int32)
Input a negative integer to (re\-)initialize the random number
generator.
Afterwards, this argument should not be modified.
.SH Description
\f[CR]RandomN\f[R] will return a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1
(exclusive of the endpoints) using the algorithm of Park and Miller
combined with a Marsaglia shift sequence.
The random number generator is intialized by calling with a negative
value of \f[CR]seed\f[R], and afterwards this variable should not be
modified.
The period of this generator is claimed to be about 3.1 10\(ha18 (see
Press et al.\ 2002).
