.SH SHTOOLS
.PP
SHTOOLS is a Fortran-95 library that can be used for spherical harmonic
transforms, multitaper spectral analyses, expansions of gridded data
into Slepian basis functions, and standard operations on global
gravitational and magnetic field data.
.SH Features
.IP \[bu] 2
Supports all standard normalizations and phase conventions of the
spherical harmonic functions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use of both regularly sampled geographic grids and grids appropriate for
Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
.IP \[bu] 2
Spherical harmonic transforms proven to be accurate up to about degree
2800.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perform localized multitaper spectral analyses, or expand gridded data
in terms of localized Slepian basis functions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perform basic operations on global gravity and magnetic field data.
.IP \[bu] 2
OpenMP compatible and OpenMP thread-safe versions of the Fortran
routines.
.SH Usage
.PP
To call the SHTOOLS routines from within a Fortran 95 program, you will
need to place the command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
use SHTOOLS
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
immediately after the program/subroutine/function name.
To compile the program, it will be necessary to link to LAPACK, BLAS,
and FFTW3 compatible libraries.
.SH License
