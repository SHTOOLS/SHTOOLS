call MakeGravGradGridDH (\f[V]cilm\f[R], \f[V]lmax\f[R], \f[V]gm\f[R],

.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[V]cilm\f[R] : input, real(dp), dimension (2, \f[V]lmax\f[R]+1, \f[V]lmax\f[R]+1)
The real 4-pi normalized gravitational potential spherical harmonic
coefficients.
The coefficients \f[V]c1lm\f[R] and \f[V]c2lm\f[R] refer to the cosine
and sine coefficients, respectively, with \f[V]c1lm=cilm(1,l+1,m+1)\f[R]
and \f[V]c2lm=cilm(2,l+1,m+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]lmax\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients
\f[V]cilm\f[R].
This determines the number of samples of the output grids,
\f[V]n=2lmax+2\f[R], and the latitudinal sampling interval,
\f[V]90/(lmax+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]gm\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the planet.
.TP
\f[V]r0\f[R]: input, real(dp)
The reference radius of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
.TP
\f[V]a\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The semi-major axis of the flattened ellipsoid on which the field is
computed.
.TP
\f[V]f\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The flattening of the reference ellipsoid:
\f[V]f=(R_equator-R_pole)/R_equator\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]vxx\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D map of the \f[V]xx\f[R] component of the gravity tensor that
conforms to the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994).
If \f[V]sampling\f[R] is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is
dimensioned as (\f[V]n\f[R] by \f[V]n\f[R]), where \f[V]n\f[R] is
\f[V]2lmax+2\f[R].
If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as
(\f[V]n\f[R] by 2\f[V]n\f[R]).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal sampling interval is 180/\f[V]n\f[R] degrees, and the
default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S.
The first longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the
longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal
sampling interval is 360/\f[V]n\f[R] for an equally sampled and
180/\f[V]n\f[R] for an equally spaced grid, respectively.
If \f[V]extend\f[R] is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the
latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the
dimensions of the grid by 1.
.TP
\f[V]vyy\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[V]yy\f[R]
component of the gravity tensor.
.TP
\f[V]vzz\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[V]zz\f[R]
component of the gravity tensor.
.TP
\f[V]vxy\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[V]xy\f[R]
component of the gravity tensor.
.TP
\f[V]vxz\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the \f[V]xz\f[R]
component of the gravity tensor.
.TP
\f[V]vyz\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the YZ component of the
gravity tensor.
.TP
\f[V]n\f[R] : output, integer(int32)
The number of samples in latitude of the output grids.
This is equal to \f[V]2lmax+2\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]sampling\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32), default = 1
If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (\f[V]n\f[R] by
\f[V]n\f[R]).
If 2, the grids are equally spaced (\f[V]n\f[R] by 2\f[V]n\f[R]).
.TP
\f[V]lmax_calc\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions.
This must be less than or equal to \f[V]lmax\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]extend\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
If 1, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
for 90 S.
This increases each of the dimensions of \f[V]griddh\f[R] by 1.
.TP
\f[V]exitstatus\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[V]MakeGravGradGridDH\f[R] will create 2-dimensional cylindrical maps
from the spherical harmonic coefficients \f[V]cilm\f[R], equally sampled
(\f[V]n\f[R] by \f[V]n\f[R]) or equally spaced (\f[V]n\f[R] by
2\f[V]n\f[R]) in latitude and longitude, for six components of the
gravity \[lq]gradient\[rq] tensor (all using geocentric coordinates):

\f[V](Vyx,  Vyy,  Vyz)\f[R]

\f[V](Vzx,  Vzy,  Vzz)\f[R]
.PP
The reference frame is north-oriented, where \f[V]x\f[R] points north,
\f[V]y\f[R] points west, and \f[V]z\f[R] points upward (all tangent or
perpendicular to a sphere of radius r).
The gravitational potential is defined as
.PP
\f[V]V = GM/r Sum_{l=0}\[ha]lmax (r0/r)\[ha]l Sum_{m=-l}\[ha]l C_{lm} Y_{lm}\f[R],
.PP
where \f[V]r0\f[R] is the reference radius of the spherical harmonic
coefficients \f[V]Clm\f[R], and the gravitational acceleration is
.PP
\f[V]B = Grad V\f[R].
.PP
The gravity tensor is symmetric, and satisfies \f[V]Vxx+Vyy+Vzz=0\f[R],
though all three diagonal elements are calculated independently in this
routine.
.PP
The components of the gravity tensor are calculated according to eq.
1 in Petrovskaya and Vershkov (2006), which is based on eq.
3.28 in Reed (1973) (noting that Reed\[cq]s equations are in terms of
latitude and that the \f[V]y\f[R] axis points east):
.PP
\f[V]Vzz = Vrr\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[V]Vxx = 1/r Vr + 1/r\[ha]2 Vtt\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[V]Vyy = 1/r Vr + 1/r\[ha]2 /tan(t) Vt + 1/r\[ha]2 /sin(t)\[ha]2 Vpp\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[V]Vxy = 1/r\[ha]2 /sin(t) Vtp - cos(t)/sin(t)\[ha]2 /r\[ha]2 Vp\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[V]Vxz = 1/r\[ha]2 Vt - 1/r Vrt\f[R]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[V]Vyz = 1/r\[ha]2 /sin(t) Vp - 1/r /sin(t) Vrp\f[R]
.PP
where \f[V]r\f[R], \f[V]t\f[R], \f[V]p\f[R] stand for radius, theta, and
phi, respectively, and subscripts on \f[V]V\f[R] denote partial
derivatives.
.PP
The output grid are in units of s\[ha]-2 and are cacluated on a
flattened ellipsoid with semi-major axis \f[V]a\f[R] and flattening
\f[V]f\f[R].
To obtain units of Eotvos (10\[ha]-9 s\[ha]-2), multiply the output by
10\[ha]9.
The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on
the ellipsoid are greater than the maximum radius of the planet (the
potential coefficients are simply downward/upward continued in the
spectral domain).
.PP
The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (\f[V]n\f[R]
by \f[V]n\f[R]), but this can be changed to use an equally spaced grid
(\f[V]n\f[R] by 2\f[V]n\f[R]) by the optional argument
\f[V]sampling\f[R].
The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying
the optional argument \f[V]extend\f[R].
