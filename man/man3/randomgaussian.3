.SH RandomGaussian
Return a pseudo\-Gaussian deviate of zero mean and unit variance.
.SH Usage
\f[CR]rg\f[R] = RandomGaussian (\f[CR]seed\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[CR]rg\f[R] : output, real(dp)
The radom Gaussian deviate.
.TP
\f[CR]seed\f[R] : input/output, integer(int32)
Input a negative integer to (re\-)initialize the random number
generator.
Afterwards, this argument should not be modified.
.SH Description
\f[CR]RandomGaussian\f[R] will return a Gaussian random deviate with
unit variance and zero mean.
The underlying random number generator uses the algorithm of Park and
Miller combined with a Marsaglia shift sequence, which is claimed to
have a periodicity of about 3.1 10\(ha18.
The random number generator is intialized by calling with a negative
value of \f[CR]seed\f[R], and afterwards, this variable should not be
modified.
To obtain a Gaussian deviate with a standard deviation of
\f[CR]sigma\f[R], it is only necessary to multiply the unit variance
deviate by \f[CR]sigma\f[R].
.PP
This is a slightly modified version of the algorithm that was published
in NUMERICAL RECIPES as GASDEV.
