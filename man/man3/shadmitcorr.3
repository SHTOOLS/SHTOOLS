.SH SHAdmitCorr
.PP
Calculate the admittance and correlation spectra of two real functions.
.SH Usage
.PP
call SHAdmitCorr (\f[V]gilm\f[R], \f[V]tilm\f[R], \f[V]lmax\f[R],
\f[V]admit\f[R], \f[V]corr\f[R], \f[V]admit_error\f[R],
\f[V]exitstatus\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[V]gilm\f[R] : input, real(dp), dimension (2, \f[V]lmaxg\f[R]+1, \f[V]lmaxg\f[R]+1)
The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function \f[V]G\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]tilm\f[R] : input, real(dp), dimension (2, \f[V]lmaxt\f[R]+1, \f[V]lmaxt\f[R]+1)
The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function \f[V]T\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]lmax\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree that will be calculated for the
admittance and correlation spectra.
This must be less than or equal to the minimum of \f[V]lmaxg\f[R] and
\f[V]lmaxt\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]admit\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (\f[V]lmax\f[R]+1)
The admittance function, which is equal to \f[V]Sgt/Stt\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]corr\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (\f[V]lmax\f[R]+1)
The degree correlation function, which is equal to
\f[V]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg Stt)\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]admit_error\f[R] : output, optional, real(dp), dimension (\f[V]lmax\f[R]+1)
The uncertainty of the admittance function, assuming that \f[V]gilm\f[R]
and \f[V]tilm\f[R] are related by a linear isotropic transfer function,
and that the lack of correlation is a result of uncorrelated noise.
.TP
\f[V]exitstatus\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[V]SHAdmitCorr\f[R] will calculate the admittance and correlation
spectra associated with two real functions expressed in real spherical
harmonics.
The admittance is defined as \f[V]Sgt/Stt\f[R], where \f[V]Sgt\f[R] is
the cross-power spectrum of two functions \f[V]G\f[R] and \f[V]T\f[R].
The degree-correlation spectrum is defined as
\f[V]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg Stt)\f[R], which can possess values between -1 and 1.
.PP
If the optional argument \f[V]admit_error\f[R] is specified, then the
error of the admittance will be calculated by assuming that \f[V]G\f[R]
and \f[V]T\f[R] are related by a linear isotropic transfer
function:\f[V]Gilm = Ql Tilm + Nilm\f[R], where \f[V]N\f[R] is noise
that is uncorrelated with the topography.
It is important to note that the relationship between two fields is
often not described by such an isotropic expression.
