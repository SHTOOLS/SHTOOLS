.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]DHaj\f[] will calculate the latitudinal weights used in the
spherical harmonic transform of Driscoll and Healy (1994; equation 9).
The number of samples \f[C]n\f[] must be even, and the transform and its
inverse are implemented as \f[C]SHExpandDH\f[] and \f[C]MakeGridDH\f[],
respectively.
It is noted that the first element, corresponding to the north pole, is
always zero.
The element corresponding to the south pole is not included.
