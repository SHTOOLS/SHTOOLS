.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]CilmPlus\f[R] will calculate the spherical harmonic coefficients of
the gravitational potential exterior to constant density relief
referenced to a spherical interface.
This is equation 10 of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998), where the
potential is strictly valid only when the coefficients are evaluated at
a radius greater than the maximum radius of the relief.
The relief is input as a grid, whose type is specified by
\f[C]gridtype\f[R] (1 for Gauss\-Legendre quadrature grids, 2 for
\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R] Driscoll and Healy sampled grids, and 3 for
\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R] Driscoll and Healy sampled grids).
The input relief \f[C]gridin\f[R] must correspond to absolute radii.
The parameter \f[C]nmax\f[R] is the order of the Taylor series used in
the algorithm to approximate the potential coefficients.
By default, the relief and spherical harmonic coefficients will be
referenced to the mean radius of \f[C]gridin\f[R].
However, if the optional parameter \f[C]dref\f[R] is specified, this
will be used instead as the reference radius.
.PP
It is important to understand that as an intermediate step, this routine
calculates the spherical harmonic coefficients of the relief (referenced
to the mean radius of \f[C]gridin\f[R] or \f[C]dref\f[R]) raised to the
nth power, i.e., \f[C](gridin\-d)\[rs]*\[rs]*n\f[R].
As such, if the input function is bandlimited to degree \f[C]L\f[R], the
resulting function will be bandlimited to degree \f[C]L*nmax\f[R].
This subroutine implicitly assumes that the \f[C]gridin\f[R] has an
effective spherical harmonic bandwidth greater or equal to this value.
(The effective bandwidth is equal to \f[C]lmax\f[R] for
\f[C]gridtype\f[R] 1, and is \f[C]n/2\-1\f[R] for \f[C]gridtype\f[R] 2
or 3.) If this is not the case, aliasing will occur.
In practice, for accurate results, it is found that the effective
bandwidth needs only to be about three times the size of \f[C]L\f[R],
though this should be verified for each application.
Thus, if the input function is considered to be bandlimited to degree
\f[C]L\f[R], the function should be evaluated on a grid corresponding to
a maximum degree of about \f[C]3*\f[R]L.
Aliasing effects can be partially mitigated by using Driscoll and Healy
\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R] grids.
.PP
If the input grid is evaluated on the Gauss\-Legendre points, it is
necessary to specify the optional parameters \f[C]w\f[R] and
\f[C]zero\f[R], or \f[C]w\f[R] and \f[C]plx\f[R], which are calculated
by a call to \f[C]SHGLQ\f[R].
In contast, if Driscoll\-Healy grids are used, it is necessary to
specify the optional parameter \f[C]n\f[R].
If memory is not an issue, the algorithm can be speeded up when using
Gauss\-Lengendre grids by inputing the optional array \f[C]plx\f[R]
(along with \f[C]w\f[R]) of precomputed associated Legendre functions on
the Gauss\-Legendre nodes.
Both of these variables are computed by a call to \f[C]SHGLQ\f[R].
.PP
This routine uses geodesy 4\-pi normalized spherical harmonics that
exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase.
