Driscoll and Healy (1994) sampling theorem.
.SH Usage
.PP
\f[C]griddh\f[] = MakeGridDH (\f[C]cilm\f[], [\f[C]lmax\f[],
\f[C]norm\f[], \f[C]sampling\f[], \f[C]csphase\f[], \f[C]lmax_calc\f[]])

.TP
.B \f[C]griddh\f[] : float, dimension (2*\f[C]lmax\f[]+2, \f[C]sampling\f[]*(2*\f[C]lmax\f[]+2))
A 2D equally sampled (default) or equally spaced map in degrees of the
spherical harmonic coefficients \f[C]cilm\f[] that conforms to the
sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994).
The first latitudinal band corresponds to 90 N, the latitudinal band for
90 S is not included, and the latitudinal sampling interval is
180/\f[C]n\f[] degrees, where \f[C]n\f[] is 2*\f[C]lmax\f[]+2.
The first longitudinal band is 0 E, the longitudinal band for 360 E is
not included, and the longitudinal sampling interval is 360/\f[C]n\f[]
for an equally sampled and 180/\f[C]n\f[] for an equally spaced grid,
respectively.

.SH Parameters
.TP
.B \f[C]cilm\f[] : float, dimension (2, \f[C]lmaxin\f[]+1, \f[C]lmaxin\f[]+1)
The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function.
The coefficients \f[C]cilm[0,l,m]\f[] and \f[C]cilm[1,l,m]\f[] refer to
the \[lq]cosine\[rq] (\f[C]Clm\f[]) and \[lq]sine\[rq] (\f[C]Slm\f[])
coefficients, respectively.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]lmax\f[] : optional, integer, default = \f[C]lmaxin\f[]
The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the function, which determines
the sampling of the output grid.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]norm\f[] : optional, integer, default = 1
1 = 4\-pi (geodesy) normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi\-normalized
harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics; 4 = orthonormal harmonics.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]sampling\f[] : optional, integer, default = 1
If 1, the output grid contains the same number of samples in latitude as
in longitude.
If 2, the grid is equally spaced in degrees, having twice as many
samples in longitude as latitude.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]csphase\f[] : optional, integer, default = 1
1 = do not apply the Condon\-Shortley phase factor to the associated
Legendre functions; \-1 = append the Condon\-Shortley phase factor of
(\-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]lmax_calc\f[] : optional, integer, default = \f[C]lmax\f[]
The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the function.
This must be less than or equal to \f[C]lmax\f[], and does not affect
the number of samples of the output grid.
.RS
.RE
.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MakeGridDH\f[] will create a 2\-dimensional map equally sampled or
equally spaced in latitude and longitude from a set of input spherical
harmonic coefficients.
This grid conforms with the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy
(1994) and this routine is the inverse of SHExpandDH.
The function is evaluated at each longitudinal band by inverse Fourier
transforming the sin and cos terms for each degree \f[C]l\f[], and then
summing over all degrees.
When evaluating the function, the maximum spherical harmonic degree that
is considered is the minimum of \f[C]lmaxin\f[], \f[C]lmax\f[], and
\f[C]lmax_calc\f[] (if specified).
.PP
The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[]
by \f[C]n\f[]), but this can be changed to use an equally spaced grid
(\f[C]n\f[] by 2\f[C]n\f[]) by use of the optional parameter
\f[C]sampling\f[].
The employed spherical harmonic normalization and Condon\-Shortley phase
convention can be set by the optional arguments \f[C]norm\f[] and
\f[C]csphase\f[]; if not set, the default is to use geodesy 4\-pi
normalized harmonics that exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase of (\-1)^m.
.PP
The normalized legendre functions are calculated using the scaling
algorithm of Holmes and Featherstone (2002), which are accurate to about
degree 2800.
The unnormalized functions are accurate only to about degree 15.
