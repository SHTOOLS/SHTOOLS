.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]BAtoHilmRhoHDH\f[] is used to solve iteratively for the relief
along an interface with lateral variations in density that corresponds
to a given Bouguer anomaly.
This is equation 18 of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998), modified to
account for density variations as in equation 30 of Wieczorek 2007,
which implicitly takes into consideration the finite\-amplitude
correction.
Each iteration takes as input a guess for the relief and outputs the
iteratively improved spherical harmonic coefficients of this relief.
These coefficients can then be re\-expanded and re\-input into this
routine as the next guess.
For the initial guess, it is often sufficient to use the relief
predicted using the first\-order \[lq]mass sheet\[rq] approximation.
The input relief \f[C]grid\f[] can be of one of three type specified by
\f[C]gridtype\f[]: 1 for Gauss\-Legendre grids, 2 for equally sampled
Driscoll\-Healy grids (\f[C]n\f[] by \f[C]n\f[]), and 3 for equally
spaced Driscoll\-Healy grids (\f[C]n\f[] by 2\f[C]n\f[]).
.PP
If the algorithm does not converge, one might want to try damping the
initial estimate.
Alternatively, iterations of the following form have proven successfulin
in damping oscilations between successive iterations:
.PP
\f[C]h3\ =\ (h2+h1)/2\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]h4\ =\ f(h3)\f[]
.PP
It is important to understand that as an intermediate step, this routine
calculates the spherical harmonic coefficients of the density multiplied
by the relief raised to the nth power.
As such, if the input function is bandlimited to degree \f[C]L\f[], the
resulting function will thus be bandlimited to degree \f[C]L*nmax\f[].
This subroutine implicitly assumes that \f[C]lmax\f[] is greater than or
equal to \f[C]L*nmax\f[].
If this is not the case, then aliasing will occur.
In practice, for accurate results, it is found that \f[C]lmax\f[] needs
only to be about twice the size of \f[C]L\f[], though this should be
verified for each application.
Thus, if the input function is considered to be bandlimited to degree
\f[C]L\f[], the function should be evaluated on a grid corresponding to
a maximum degree of about \f[C]2L\f[].
.PP
This routine uses geodesy 4\-pi normalized spherical harmonics that
exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase; This can not be modified.
