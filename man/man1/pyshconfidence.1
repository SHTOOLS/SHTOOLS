.PP
Compute the probability that two functions are correlated at a given
spherical harmonic degree for a given correlation coefficient.

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]SHConfidence\f[] will calculate the probability (between 0 and 1)
that two sets of spherical harmonic coefficients with spectral
correlation \f[C]corr\f[] are linearly correlated at a given degree.
This is calculated using equation A7 from Pauer et al.
(2006).
