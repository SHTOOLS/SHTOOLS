.SH Description
.PP
This function will read spherical harmonic coefficients from an
ascii\-formatted text file.
The errors associated with the spherical harmonic coefficients, as well
as the values in a single header line, can optionally be read by setting
the optional parameters \f[C]error\f[] and \f[C]header\f[] to True.
The optional parameter \f[C]skip\f[] specifies how many lines should be
skipped before attempting to parse the file, and the optional parameter
\f[C]lmax\f[] specifies the maximum degree to read from the file.
Both real and complex spherical harmonic coefficients are supported.
.PP
The spherical harmonic coefficients in the file should be formatted as
.PP
\f[C]l,\ m,\ coeffs[0,\ l,\ m],\ coeffs[1,\ l,\ m]\f[]
.PP
where l and m are the spherical harmonic degree and order, respectively.
The terms coeffs[1, l, 0] can be neglected as they are zero.
If the errors are to be read, the line should be formatted as For more
information, see \f[C]shread\f[].
.PP
If the errors are to be read, the line should be formatted as
.PP
\f[C]l,\ m,\ coeffs[0,\ l,\ m],\ coeffs[1,\ l,\ m],\ errors[0,\ l,\ m],\ errors[1,\ l,\ m]\f[]
.PP
For each value of increasing l, all the angular orders are listed in
inceasing order, from 0 to l.
.PP
If a header line is to be read, it should be located directly after the
first lines to be skipped, before the start of the spherical harmonic
coefficents.
The header values are returned as a list, where each value is formatted
as a string.
.PP
A valid line must contain at least 3 words, and the first two words must
be integers.
When reading the file, all other lines will be considered as
\[lq]comments\[rq] and will be ignored.
