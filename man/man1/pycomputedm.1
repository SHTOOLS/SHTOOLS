.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]ComputeDM\f[] will calculate the space\-concentration kernel of
angular order \f[C]m\f[] for the spherical\-cap concentration problem.
The eigenfunctions of this matrix correspond to a family of orthogonal
windowing functions, and the eigenvalues correspond to the window's
concentration factor (i.e., the power of the window within
\f[C]theta0\f[] divided by the total power of the function).
It is assumed that the employed spherical harmonic functions are
normalized to the same value for all degrees and angular orders, which
is the case for both the geodesy 4\-pi and orthonormalized harmonics.
This kernel is symmetric and is computed exactly by Gauss\-Legendre
quadrature.
