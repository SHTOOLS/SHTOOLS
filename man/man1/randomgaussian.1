.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]RandomGaussian\f[] will return a Gaussian random deviate with unit
variance and zero mean.
The underlying random number generator uses the algorithm of Park and
Miller combined with a Marsaglia shift sequence, which is claimed to
have a periodicity of about 3.1 10^18.
The random number generator is intialized by calling with a negative
value of \f[C]seed\f[], and afterwards, this variable should not be
modified.
To obtain a Gaussian deviate with a standard deviation of
\f[C]sigma\f[], it is only necessary to multiply the unit variance
deviate by \f[C]sigma\f[].
.PP
This is a slightly modified version of the algorithm that was published
in NUMERICAL RECIPES as GASDEV.
