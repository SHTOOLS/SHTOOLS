\f[C]dj\f[] = pyshtools.djpi2 (\f[C]lmax\f[])
.SH Returns
.TP
.B \f[C]dj\f[] : float, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1, \f[C]lmax\f[]+1, \f[C]lmax\f[]+1)

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]djpi2\f[] will calculate the rotation matrix
\f[C]d_{mM}^j\ (pi/2)\f[] that is used in rotating spherical harmonics
in the routines \f[C]SHRotateRealCoef\f[] and \f[C]SHRotateCoef\f[].
.PP
This routine is based on code originally written by Guy Masters,
subsequently modified by Mark Simons, and finally turned into f95 code
by myself.
