.SH SHAdmitCorr
.PP
Calculate the admittance and correlation spectra of two real functions.
.SH Usage
.PP
call SHAdmitCorr (\f[C]gilm\f[], \f[C]tilm\f[], \f[C]lmax\f[],
\f[C]admit\f[], \f[C]corr\f[], \f[C]admit_error\f[],
\f[C]exitstatus\f[])
.SH Parameters
.TP
.B \f[C]gilm\f[] : input, real*8, dimension (2, \f[C]lmaxg\f[]+1, \f[C]lmaxg\f[]+1)
The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function \f[C]G\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]tilm\f[] : input, real*8, dimension (2, \f[C]lmaxt\f[]+1, \f[C]lmaxt\f[]+1)
The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function \f[C]T\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]lmax\f[] : input, integer
The maximum spherical harmonic degree that will be calculated for the
admittance and correlation spectra.
This must be less than or equal to the minimum of \f[C]lmaxg\f[] and
\f[C]lmaxt\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]admit\f[] : output, real*8, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1)
The admittance function, which is equal to \f[C]Sgt/Stt\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]corr\f[] : output, real*8, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1)
The degree correlation function, which is equal to
\f[C]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg\ Stt)\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]admit_error\f[] : output, optional, real*8, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1)
The uncertainty of the admittance function, assuming that \f[C]gilm\f[]
and \f[C]tilm\f[] are related by a linear isotropic transfer function,
and that the lack of correlation is a result of uncorrelated noise.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]exitstatus\f[] : output, optional, integer
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]SHAdmitCorr\f[] will calculate the admittance and correlation
spectra associated with two real functions expressed in real spherical
harmonics.
The admittance is defined as \f[C]Sgt/Stt\f[], where \f[C]Sgt\f[] is the
cross\-power spectrum of two functions \f[C]G\f[] and \f[C]T\f[].
The degree\-correlation spectrum is defined as
\f[C]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg\ Stt)\f[], which can possess values between \-1 and 1.
.PP
If the optional argument \f[C]admit_error\f[] is specified, then the
error of the admittance will be calculated by assuming that \f[C]G\f[]
and \f[C]T\f[] are related by a linear isotropic transfer
function:\f[C]Gilm\ =\ Ql\ Tilm\ +\ Nilm\f[], where \f[C]N\f[] is noise
that is uncorrelated with the topography.
It is important to note that the relationship between two fields is
often not described by such an isotropic expression.
