.PP
\f[C]admit\f[], \f[C]error\f[], \f[C]corr\f[] = SHAdmitCorr

.SH Returns
.TP
.B \f[C]admit\f[] : float, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1)
The admittance function, which is equal to \f[C]Sgt/Stt\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]error\f[] : float, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1)
The uncertainty of the admittance function, assuming that \f[C]gilm\f[]
and \f[C]tilm\f[] are related by a linear isotropic transfer function,
and that the lack of correlation is a result of uncorrelated noise.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[C]corr\f[] : float, dimension (\f[C]lmax\f[]+1)
The degree correlation function, which is equal to
\f[C]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg\ Stt)\f[].

.TP
.B \f[C]lmax\f[] : optional, integer, default = min(\f[C]lmaxg\f[], \f[C]lmaxt\f[])
The maximum spherical harmonic degree that will be calculated for the
admittance and correlation spectra.

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]SHAdmitCorr\f[] will calculate the admittance, admittance error,
and correlation spectra associated with two real functions expressed in
real spherical harmonics.
The admittance is defined as \f[C]Sgt/Stt\f[], where \f[C]Sgt\f[] is the
cross\-power spectrum of two functions \f[C]G\f[] and \f[C]T\f[].
The degree\-correlation spectrum is defined as
\f[C]Sgt/sqrt(Sgg\ Stt)\f[], which can possess values between \-1 and 1.
The error of the admittance is calculated assuming that \f[C]G\f[] and
\f[C]T\f[] are related by a linear isotropic transfer
function:\f[C]Gilm\ =\ Ql\ Tilm\ +\ Nilm\f[], where \f[C]N\f[] is noise
that is uncorrelated with the topography.
It is important to note that the relationship between two fields is
often not described by such an isotropic expression.
