.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MakeGravGradGridDH\f[] will create 2\-dimensional cylindrical maps
from the spherical harmonic coefficients \f[C]cilm\f[], equally sampled
(\f[C]n\f[] by \f[C]n\f[]) or equally spaced (\f[C]n\f[] by 2\f[C]n\f[])
in latitude and longitude, for six components of the gravity
\[lq]gradient\[rq] tensor (all using geocentric coordinates):
.PP
\f[C](Vxx,\ \ Vxy,\ \ Vxz)\f[]
.PD 0

.PD
\f[C](Vyx,\ \ Vyy,\ \ Vyz)\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C](Vzx,\ \ Vzy,\ \ Vzz)\f[]
.PP
The reference frame is north\-oriented, where \f[C]x\f[] points north,
\f[C]y\f[] points west, and \f[C]z\f[] points upward (all tangent or
perpendicular to a sphere of radius r).
The gravitational potential is defined as
.PP
\f[C]V\ =\ GM/r\ Sum_{l=0}^lmax\ (r0/r)^l\ Sum_{m=\-l}^l\ C_{lm}\ Y_{lm}\f[],
.PP
where \f[C]r0\f[] is the reference radius of the spherical harmonic
coefficients \f[C]Clm\f[], and the gravitational acceleration is
.PP
\f[C]B\ =\ Grad\ V\f[].
.PP
The gravity tensor is symmetric, and satisfies \f[C]Vxx+Vyy+Vzz=0\f[],
though all three diagonal elements are calculated independently in this
routine.
.PP
The components of the gravity tensor are calculated according to eq.
1 in Petrovskaya and Vershkov (2006), which is based on eq.
3.28 in Reed (1973) (noting that Reed's equations are in terms of
latitude and that the \f[C]y\f[] axis points east):
.PP
\f[C]Vzz\ =\ Vrr\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]Vxx\ =\ 1/r\ Vr\ +\ 1/r^2\ Vtt\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]Vyy\ =\ 1/r\ Vr\ +\ 1/r^2\ /tan(t)\ Vt\ +\ 1/r^2\ /sin(t)^2\ Vpp\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]Vxy\ =\ 1/r^2\ /sin(t)\ Vtp\ \-\ cos(t)/sin(t)^2\ /r^2\ Vp\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]Vxz\ =\ 1/r^2\ Vt\ \-\ 1/r\ Vrt\f[]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]Vyz\ =\ 1/r^2\ /sin(t)\ Vp\ \-\ 1/r\ /sin(t)\ Vrp\f[]
.PP
where \f[C]r\f[], \f[C]t\f[], \f[C]p\f[] stand for radius, theta, and
phi, respectively, and subscripts on \f[C]V\f[] denote partial
derivatives.
.PP
The output grid are in units of s^\-2 and are cacluated on a flattened
ellipsoid with semi\-major axis \f[C]a\f[] and flattening \f[C]f\f[].
To obtain units of Eotvos (10^\-9 s^\-2), multiply the output by 10^9.
The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on
the ellipsoid are less than the maximum radius of the planet (the
potential coefficients are simply downward continued in the spectral
domain).
.PP
The default is to calculate grids for use in the Driscoll and Healy
(1994) routines that are equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[] by \f[C]n\f[]), but
this can be changed to calculate equally spaced grids (\f[C]n\f[] by
2\f[C]n\f[]) by setting the optional argument \f[C]sampling\f[] to 2.
The input value of \f[C]lmax\f[] determines the number of samples,
\f[C]n=2lmax+2\f[], and the latitudinal sampling interval,
90/(\f[C]lmax\f[]+1).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal band for 90 S is not calculated, and the latitudinal
sampling interval is 180/\f[C]n\f[] degrees.
The first longitudinal band is 0 E, the longitudinal band for 360 E is
not calculated, and the longitudinal sampling interval is 360/\f[C]n\f[]
for equally sampled and 180/\f[C]n\f[] for equally spaced grids,
respectively.
