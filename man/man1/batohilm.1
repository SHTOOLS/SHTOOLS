.SH Description
.PP
I\f[C]BAtoHilm\f[] is used to solve iteratively for the relief along an
interface that corresponds to a given Bouguer anomaly.
This is equation 18 of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998) which implicitly
takes into consideration the finite\-amplitude correction.
Each iteration takes as input a guess for the relief (specified by
\f[C]grid\f[]) and outputs the iteratively improved spherical harmonic
coefficients of this relief.
These coefficients can then be re\-expanded and re\-input into this
routine as the next guess.
For the initial guess, it is often sufficient to use the relief
predicted using the first\-order \[lq]mass sheet\[rq] approximation.
The input relief \f[C]grid\f[] can be of one of three type specified by
\f[C]gridtype\f[]: 1 for Gauss\-Legendre grids, 2 for equally sampled
Driscoll\-Healy grids (\f[C]n\f[] by \f[C]n\f[]), and 3 for equally
spaced Driscoll\-Healy grid (\f[C]n\f[] by 2\f[C]n\f[]).
.PP
If the algorithm does not converge, one might want to try damping the
initial estimate.
Alternatively, iterations of the following form have proven successfulin
in damping oscilations between successive iterations:
.PP
\f[C]h3\ =\ (h2+h1)/2\f[] \f[C]h4\ =\ f(h3)\f[]
.PP
It is important to understand that as an intermediate step, this routine
calculates the spherical harmonic coefficients of the relief raised to
the nth power, i.e., grid**n.
As such, if the input function is bandlimited to degree \f[C]L\f[], the
resulting function will thus be bandlimited to degree \f[C]L*nmax\f[].
This subroutine implicitly assumes that \f[C]lmax\f[] is greater than or
equal to \f[C]L*nmax\f[].
If this is not the case, aliasing will occur.
In practice, for accurate results, it is found that \f[C]lmax\f[] needs
only to be about twice the size of \f[C]L\f[], though this should be
verified for each application.
Thus, if the input function is considered to be bandlimited to degree
\f[C]L\f[], the function should be evaluated on a grid corresponding to
a maximum degree of about \f[C]2L\f[].
.PP
If the input grid is evaluated on the Gauss\-Legendre points, it is
necessary to specify the optional parameters \f[C]w\f[]
and\f[C]zero\f[], or \f[C]w\f[] and \f[C]plx\f[], which are calculated
by a call to \f[C]SHGLQ\f[].
If memory is not an issue, the algorithm can be speeded up by inputing
the optional array \f[C]plx\f[] of precomputed associated Legendre
functions on the Gauss\-Legendre nodes.
If \f[C]plx\f[] is not specified, then it is necessary to input the
optional array \f[C]zero\f[] that contains the latitudinal
Gauss\-Legendre quadrature nodes.
.PP
This routine uses geodesy 4\-pi normalized spherical harmonics that
exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase.
