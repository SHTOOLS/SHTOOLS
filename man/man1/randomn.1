Return a pseudo uniform random deviate between 0 and 1 using the
algorithm of Park and Miller with a Marsaglia shift sequence.
.SH Usage
.PP
\f[C]rn\f[] = RandomN (\f[C]seed\f[])
.SH Parameters
.TP
.B \f[C]rn\f[] : output, real*8
The uniform random deviate.
.RS

.TP
.B \f[C]seed\f[] : input/output, integer
Input a negative integer to (re\-)initialize the random number
generator.
Afterwards, this argument should not be modified.

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]RandomN\f[] will return a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1
(exclusive of the endpoints) using the algorithm of Park and Miller
combined with a Marsaglia shift sequence.
The random number generator is intialized by calling with a negative
value of \f[C]seed\f[], and afterwards this variable should not be
modified.
The period of this generator is claimed to be about 3.1 10^18 (see Press
et al.\ 2002).
