.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]CilmMinusRhoH\f[] will calculate the spherical harmonic
coefficients of the gravitational potential interior to relief
referenced to a spherical interface with laterally varying density.
This is a generalization of equation 30 of Wieczorek (2007), and
equation 12 of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998).
The potential is strictly valid only when the coefficients are evaluated
at a radius greater than the maximum radius of the relief.
The relief and laterally varying density are input as a grid, whose type
is specified by \f[C]gridtype\f[] (1 for Gauss\-Legendre quadrature
grids, 2 for \f[C]n\f[] by \f[C]n\f[] Driscoll and Healy sampled grids,
and 3 for \f[C]n\f[] by 2\f[C]n\f[] Driscoll and Healy sampled grids).
The input relief \f[C]gridin\f[] must correspond to absolute radii.
The parameter \f[C]nmax\f[] is the order of the Taylor series used in
the algorithm to approximate the potential coefficients.
By default, the relief and spherical harmonic coefficients will be
referenced to the mean radius of \f[C]gridin\f[].
However, if the optional parameter \f[C]dref\f[] is specified, this will
be used instead as the reference radius.
.PP
It is important to understand that as an intermediate step, this routine
calculates the spherical harmonic coefficients of the density multiplied
by the relief (referenced to the mean radius of \f[C]gridin\f[] or
\f[C]dref\f[]) raised to the nth power.
As such, if the input function is bandlimited to degree \f[C]L\f[], the
resulting function will be bandlimited to degree \f[C]L*nmax\f[].
This subroutine implicitly assumes that \f[C]gridin\f[] and \f[C]rho\f[]
have an effective spherical harmonic bandwidth greater or equal to this
value.
(The effective bandwidth is equal to \f[C]lmax\f[] for \f[C]gridtype\f[]
1, and is \f[C]n/2\-1\f[] for \f[C]gridtype\f[] 2 or 3.) If this is not
the case, aliasing will occur.
In practice, for accurate results, it is found that the effective
bandwidth needs only to be about three times the size of \f[C]L\f[],
though this should be verified for each application.
Thus, if the input function is considered to be bandlimited to degree
\f[C]L\f[], the function should be evaluated on a grid corresponding to
a maximum degree of about \f[C]3*\f[]L.
Aliasing effects can be partially mitigated by using Driscoll and Healy
\f[C]n\f[] by 2\f[C]n\f[] grids.
.PP
If the input grid is evaluated on the Gauss\-Legendre points, it is
necessary to specify the optional parameters \f[C]w\f[] and
\f[C]zero\f[], or \f[C]w\f[] and \f[C]plx\f[], which are calculated by a
call to \f[C]SHGLQ\f[].
In contast, if Driscoll\-Healy grids are used, it is necessary to
specify the optional parameter \f[C]n\f[].
If memory is not an issue, the algorithm can be speeded up when using
Gauss\-Lengendre grids by inputing the optional array \f[C]plx\f[]
(along with \f[C]w\f[]) of precomputed associated Legendre functions on
the Gauss\-Legendre nodes.
Both of these variables are computed by a call to \f[C]SHGLQ\f[].
.PP
This routine uses geodesy 4\-pi normalized spherical harmonics that
exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase.
