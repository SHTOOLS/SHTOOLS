The spherical harmonic coefficients of the \f[C](lmax+1)**2\f[]
localization windows.
Each column contains the coefficients of a single window that possesses
non\-zero coefficients for the single angular order specified in
\f[C]taper_order\f[].
The first and last rows of each column correspond to spherical harmonic
degrees 0 and \f[C]lmax\f[], respectively, and the columns are arranged
from best to worst concentrated.

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]SHReturnTapers\f[] will calculate the eigenfunctions (i.e.,
localization windows) of the spherical\-cap concentration problem.
Each column of the matrix \f[C]tapers\f[] contains the spherical
harmonic coefficients of a single window and the corresponding
concentration factor is given in the array \f[C]eigenvalues\f[].
Each window has non\-zero coefficients for only a single angular order
that is specified in \f[C]taper_order\f[]: all other spherical harmonic
coefficients for a given window are identically zero.
The columns of \f[C]tapers\f[] are ordered from best to worst
concentrated, and the first and last rows of each column correspond to
spherical harmonic degrees 0 and \f[C]lmax\f[], respectively.
The localization windows are normalized such that they have unit power.
