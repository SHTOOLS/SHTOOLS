the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]ComputeDG82\f[] will calculate the tridiagonal matrix of Grunbaum
et al.
(1982) that commutes with the space\-concentration kernel of order
\f[C]m\f[] of a spherical cap.
The eigenfunctions of this matrix correspond to a family of orthogonal
windowing functions, and the eigenvalues correspond to the window's
concentration factor (i.e., the power of the window within
\f[C]theta0\f[] divided by the total power of the function).
It is assumed that the employed spherical harmonic functions are
normalized to the same value for all degrees and angular orders, which
is the case for both the geodesy 4\-pi and orthonormalized harmonics.
The returned matrix is symmetric, and the first element corresponds to
(abs(\f[C]m\f[]), abs(\f[C]m\f[])) as the values for elements less than
this are identically zero.
