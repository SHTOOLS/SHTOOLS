.SH SHTOOLS
.PP
SHTOOLS is an archive of Fortran 95 and Python software that can be used
to perform spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions, rotations
of data expressed in spherical harmonics, and multitaper spectral
analyses on the sphere.
.SH Features
.IP \[bu] 2
Supports all standard normalizations and phase conventions of the
spherical harmonic functions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use of both regularly sampled geographic grids and grids appropriate for
Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
.IP \[bu] 2
Spherical harmonic transforms proven to be accurate up to about degree
2800.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perform localized multitaper spectral analyses, or expand functions in
terms of localized Slepian basis.
.IP \[bu] 2
Perform basic operations on global gravity and magnetic field data.
.IP \[bu] 2
OpenMP compatible and OpenMP thread-safe versions of the Fortran
routines.
.SH Usage
.PP
To call the SHTOOLS routines from within a Fortran 95 program, you will
need to place the command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
use SHTOOLS
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
immediately after the program/subroutine/function name.
To compile the program, it will be necessary to link to LAPACK, BLAS,
and FFTW3 compatible libraries.
.SH License

The SHTOOLS software package is entirely free and open source.
It can be modified and distributed according to the 3-clause BSD
