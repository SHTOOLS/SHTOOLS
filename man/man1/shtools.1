.SH SHTOOLS
.PP
SHTOOLS is an archive of Fortran 95 and Python software that can be used
to perform spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions, rotations
of data expressed in spherical harmonics, and multitaper spectral
analyses on the sphere.
.SH Features
.PP
SHTOOLS is extremely versatile:
.IP \[bu] 2
It can accommodate any standard normalization of the spherical harmonic
functions (\[lq]geodesy\[rq] 4\-pi; normalized, Schmidt
semi\-normalized, orthonormalized, and unnormalized).
.IP \[bu] 2
Both real and complex spherical harmonics are supported.
.IP \[bu] 2
Spherical harmonic transforms are calculated by exact quadrature rules
using either the sampling theorem of \f[I]Driscoll and Healy\f[] (1994)
where data are equally sampled (or spaced) in latitude and longitude, or
Gauss\-Legendre quadrature.
.IP \[bu] 2
One can choose to use or exclude the Condon\-Shortley phase factor of
(\-1)^m with the associated Legendre functions.
.IP \[bu] 2
The spherical harmonic transforms are proven to be accurate to
approximately degree 2800, corresponding to a spatial resolution of
better than 4 arc minutes.
.IP \[bu] 2
Routines are included for performing localized multitaper spectral
analyses.
.IP \[bu] 2
Routines are included for performing standard gravity and magnetic field
calculations, such as computation of the geoid and the determination of
the potential associated with finite\-amplitude topography.
.IP \[bu] 2
The routines are fast.
Spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions take on the order of 1
second for bandwidths less than 600 and about 3 minutes for bandwidths
close to 2800.
.SH Usage
.PP
To call the SHTOOLS routines from within a Fortran 95 program, you will
need to place the command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
use\ SHTOOLS
\f[]
.fi
.PP
immediately after the program/subroutine/function name.
To compile the program, use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
gfortran\ \-I/usr/local/include\ \-m64\ \-fPIC\ \-O3\ \-L/usr/local/lib\ \-lSHTOOLS\ \-lfftw3\ \-lm\ \-llapack\ \-lblas
\f[]
.fi
.PP
To use SHTOOLS in Python, enter the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
import\ sys
sys.path.append(\[aq]/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site\-packages\[aq])
import\ pyshtools\ as\ shtools
\f[]
.fi
