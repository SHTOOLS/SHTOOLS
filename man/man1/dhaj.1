call DHaj (\f[C]n\f[], \f[C]aj\f[], \f[C]exitstatus\f[])
.SH Parameters
.TP
.B \f[C]n\f[] : input, integer
The number of samples in latitude used in the spherical harmonic
transform.
This must be even.

.TP
.B \f[C]exitstatus\f[] : output, optional, integer
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO

.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]DHaj\f[] will calculate the latitudinal weights used in the
spherical harmonic transform of Driscoll and Healy (1994; equation 9).
The number of samples \f[C]n\f[] must be even, and the transform and its
inverse are implemented as \f[C]SHExpandDH\f[] and \f[C]MakeGridDH\f[],
respectively.
It is noted that the first element, corresponding to the north pole, is
always zero.
The element corresponding to the south pole is not included.
