.SH DHaj
.PP
Compute the latitudinal weights used in the Driscoll and Healy (1994)
spherical harmonic transform.
.SH Usage
.PP
call DHaj (\f[C]n\f[R], \f[C]aj\f[R], \f[C]exitstatus\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]n\f[B]\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The number of samples in latitude used in the spherical harmonic
transform.
This must be even.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]aj\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (\f[B]\f[CB]n\f[B]\f[R]) or (\f[B]\f[CB]n\f[B]\f[R]+1)
The latitudinal weights used in the spherical harmonic transform.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]extend\f[B]\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
If 1, include the latitudinal band for 90 S, which increases the
dimension of \f[C]aj\f[R] by 1.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]exitstatus\f[B]\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]DHaj\f[R] will calculate the latitudinal weights used in the
spherical harmonic transform of Driscoll and Healy (1994; equation 9).
The number of samples \f[C]n\f[R] must be even, and the transform and
its inverse are implemented as \f[C]SHExpandDH\f[R] and
\f[C]MakeGridDH\f[R], respectively.
It is noted that the first element, corresponding to the north pole, is
always zero.
The element corresponding to the south pole is not included by default,
but can be returned by specifying \f[C]extend\f[R].
